1
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.480
Michael Shannon: Alright, welcome back from break everybody it's the ci ssp boot camp.

2
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.090
Michael Shannon: With Michael and David.

3
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:35.670
Michael Shannon: So as a security practitioner one who's wearing that management, a hat, we have to align our security functions our controls our initiatives or programs.

4
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:52.080
Michael Shannon: With our business our business strategy, whatever our value proposition is, do we have a mission, a charter objectives you have to always be cognizant of our contribution not only to.

5
00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:04.590
Michael Shannon: Meeting the perhaps we're doing it to be accredited or certified right, we have to meet some regulation or mandate, because of the industry we're in.

6
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.320
Michael Shannon: But not only that, how do we help add value.

7
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:24.330
Michael Shannon: We may have our own customers, we may be a service provider ourselves okay our partners are relying upon us strategic partners large vendors and customers.

8
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:37.290
Michael Shannon: Right, so a lot of this is going to be driven not by just by corporate governance but corporate governance itself should drive a security, governance.

9
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.550
Michael Shannon: We have to be able to react to changes if we're going to go through a merger we're going to our company's being sold to some other company.

10
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.030
Michael Shannon: Often there's like will be called a dark period there where we have to be highly concerned about you know, privacy and intellectual property.

11
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:14.580
Michael Shannon: There may be legal ramifications, maybe if we're under an investigation suddenly other legal holds on data or files or assets, what if those assets are being stored in a cloud provider.

12
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:26.550
Michael Shannon: Okay, anything that changes the way our company is structured we go from a privately held company company to a publicly held company David and I have been around.

13
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.910
Michael Shannon: This institution long enough.

14
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:40.290
Michael Shannon: To kind of go through that I think I don't know, maybe four times public than private or private and public and private than public.

15
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.930
Michael Shannon: And it, you know it introduces complexities.

16
00:02:47.370 --> 00:03:02.160
Michael Shannon: Privacy issues data sharing interconnection agreements, who might have with as part of our disaster recovery business continuity options connectivity agreements with service providers.

17
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.200
Michael Shannon: there's internal and external influences from a security, governance standpoint.

18
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:25.890
Michael Shannon: Are we, a more traditional type of top down company with a very strict you know vertical chain of command or a very functional were very departmental.

19
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.760
Michael Shannon: In a in a more traditional functional environment, you may have more silos or siloed areas.

20
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:55.380
Michael Shannon: If you've been involved in security long enough, you know it used to be and it's kind of like where devops came from, but early on the people that were involved with writing the Code and the people that were involved with the operational aspect were siloed.

21
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:14.190
Michael Shannon: You can you can be involved in security, but you had no access to the database and the database people from a security standpoint, it was basically network security infrastructure, the database people they were doing their database admin stuff.

22
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.790
Michael Shannon: Maybe even to some degrees server admins.

23
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:32.550
Michael Shannon: Today, those those relationships are flatter we often see more project ties organizations, where an individual may have a certain job title.

24
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:55.740
Michael Shannon: But they can be working horizontally in different business units and departments, maybe simultaneously or they move from one project to another throughout the organization or the campus obviously executive management our management structure our C suite RC team as a security.

25
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:09.270
Michael Shannon: architect do I answer to another security architect or do I answer to somebody in the C suite the CIO the CIO so do we have a chief privacy officer.

26
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.230
Michael Shannon: We have internal auditors.

27
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.800
Michael Shannon: And those might be certified public accountants in the accounting department or maybe other types of specialized auditors.

28
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.500
Michael Shannon: That have to answer to our insurance company, for example.

29
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.830
Michael Shannon: Maybe maybe as an organization, we have a private cloud.

30
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:49.770
Michael Shannon: So we've converted our data Center into a more virtualized hypervisor driven data Center and we provide the same type of services.

31
00:05:50.430 --> 00:06:05.970
Michael Shannon: That a cloud provider would offer we offer sandbox environments and development environments, we they have the ability to use their budgets to do research and development or development using our private cloud.

32
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.480
Michael Shannon: We have to always again from an internal standpoint know our key value propositions.

33
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.540
Michael Shannon: Right service product or both, and then external.

34
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.700
Michael Shannon: influences will affect our security, governance.

35
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:36.240
Michael Shannon: If you're a public company, you may have to you have to respond to stockholders and bondholders maybe you're part of a partnership.

36
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.220
Michael Shannon: You have to be aware that your customers and your clients.

37
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:50.610
Michael Shannon: have an incredible amount of influence, your lenders Okay, if you have a data breach.

38
00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:07.800
Michael Shannon: of credit card information, for example, that's going to affect your customers that's a secondary kind of cascading loss that you're gonna have to deal with, but when you put you know you provide credit, you know protection.

39
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:22.620
Michael Shannon: For your customers, maybe with lenders, if you have a data breach a secondary loss might be something like well you're going to pay higher interest rates for that borrowing next time.

40
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:30.660
Michael Shannon: We can be affected by social, political, socio political, economic factors right.

41
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.470
Michael Shannon: pandemics war.

42
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:48.030
Michael Shannon: Okay supply chains can be affected vendors that we used, two years ago, two and a half years ago, may not even be in business anymore.

43
00:07:48.840 --> 00:08:01.380
Michael Shannon: A software vendor a hardware vendor or that particular vendors only operating at 75% they're barely keeping their head above water trying to ride out the storm.

44
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.220
Michael Shannon: disruptions in the supply chain more regulation okay.

45
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:29.190
Michael Shannon: So, you know as a security practitioner obviously we're heavily involved in access, controls right access to resources and assets, so we need to have our finger on the pulse of our the way organization is designed roles responsibilities processes.

46
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:42.330
Michael Shannon: Okay, and there's no one size fits all you may have a large global company that operates differently at the headquarters, then they do it a regional branch office or a satellite office.

47
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:57.750
Michael Shannon: The responsibilities and roles may drive your access control methodology, if you have a role, based access control.

48
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:19.830
Michael Shannon: or even if it's discretionary often in a discretionary access control model like windows with active directory your groups your global groups are often they can be built on roles like network administrators database administrator, but they can also be departmental.

49
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:29.430
Michael Shannon: Your role based access control, for example, if you're working at a medical Center and use a role based model.

50
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:37.110
Michael Shannon: You need to be aware of the different roles medical doctor nurse practitioner.

51
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.500
Michael Shannon: Registered nurse technician.

52
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.180
Michael Shannon: we're going to talk more about.

53
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:55.560
Michael Shannon: These access control models, of course, like like today, this is all under the umbrella of understanding the responsibilities of security, governance.

54
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:04.170
Michael Shannon: Okay trust me most of the things we've even brought up we're going to revisit them again, because if you go back to.

55
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.480
Michael Shannon: This.

56
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.740
Michael Shannon: Waiting of domains.

57
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:25.410
Michael Shannon: Well, it goes without saying that there's a lot of overlap in these domains, I mean part of security operations number seven is securing your assets.

58
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
Michael Shannon: What how you operate yours, how do you.

59
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:39.660
Michael Shannon: put into practice, your controls in operations will be based on how you handle and treat risk.

60
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.040
Michael Shannon: Right now, I can pretty much.

61
00:10:45.180 --> 00:11:01.740
Michael Shannon: isolate software development, security as a domain, but that's also going to be driven by your security architecture, so the point i'm making is there's a lot of overlaps in the domains, which by the way, is why to be.

62
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:15.840
Michael Shannon: qualified to take the exam you don't have to have four or five years of real world fully paid experience in all eight domains.

63
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:30.840
Michael Shannon: Because there's so much overlap and so that kind of ties into the fact that many of the things that we talked about today we'll revisit these again when we get into the operational and the practical aspect of them.

64
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:48.240
Michael Shannon: Now owning something ownership ownership of the data ownership of the file you create the data you create we often see that in more discretionary or role based models.

65
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.270
Michael Shannon: So an owner.

66
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:59.040
Michael Shannon: Typically, you see those in certain access control models, for example in a mandatory access control model.

67
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.810
Michael Shannon: A MAC model it sucks it's rare, if not.

68
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.700
Michael Shannon: Just exclusively, there is no ownership.

69
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.140
Michael Shannon: And a strict mandatory access control model.

70
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.300
Michael Shannon: The ownership is the entity, the Agency.

71
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.460
Michael Shannon: owner everything.

72
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:31.470
Michael Shannon: But a discretionary models, you can create directories and folders and when you open, you know when you create a word document or a PowerPoint.

73
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:45.000
Michael Shannon: Presentation or an excel spreadsheet or something else, something maybe in sharepoint you're the owner of that, and you have the discretion to share it and even assign permissions.

74
00:12:48.180 --> 00:13:00.480
Michael Shannon: If you're in a corporate environment to use classification levels owners may determine those levels as well owners can determine how things are labeled or tagged.

75
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:09.210
Michael Shannon: there's an existing schema of key value pairs and the owner of the.

76
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:25.020
Michael Shannon: object either locally or in the cloud tags it with key value pairs owners often do that, we have data ownership, we also may have asset ownership okay technically.

77
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.820
Michael Shannon: I may not be an owner of my corporate laptop here.

78
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:49.230
Michael Shannon: But I may be a steward or a custodian of it Okay, so you have stewards and notice protect my data but also assets in general data is just one of our assets and probably for many organizations are most important.

79
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:57.420
Michael Shannon: opt in the most mission critical asset that a company has this data, not all companies right.

80
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.230
Michael Shannon: Some companies actually consider their employees to be their most valuable assets.

81
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.110
Michael Shannon: But not all not all companies operate, not all organizations operate that way.

82
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.580
Michael Shannon: Often, and when I talk about stewards versus custodians.

83
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.960
Michael Shannon: Which is kind of to differentiation is, you have to have here.

84
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:27.030
Michael Shannon: I mean a hard time driving my slides forward hold on like stewards versus custodians okay.

85
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:39.330
Michael Shannon: I don't like to use a lot of cultural references because i've students from all over the world and we don't watch the same movies, we don't listen to the same music.

86
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:50.880
Michael Shannon: We don't watch the same TV shows, but there is a there's a show it's a reality show it's called below deck and so what it is it's just luxury.

87
00:14:51.480 --> 00:15:01.260
Michael Shannon: yachts in the Mediterranean or Greece or whatever and it's just the drama of all the people that are working on the yacht.

88
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:06.480
Michael Shannon: And then you know the rich drunk people and all of that drama right it's the reality show.

89
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:24.840
Michael Shannon: Well, you know, on these luxury yachts you have stewards and you have custodians that the stewards deal with the customers, the people that are paying to come out of the yacht for three days from a business perspective, they deal with internal and external customers.

90
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:46.230
Michael Shannon: Because a steward of data or other assets may be there for quality control, ensuring compliance okay stewart's the ones that do with internal external customers often maybe compliance and regulators auditors a custodian is more of a technical.

91
00:15:47.790 --> 00:16:00.990
Michael Shannon: For example, on the on the yacht it would be the first Mate, and the second Mate, and the third mate and they they interface with engineer, and the captain so assets from a technical perspective.

92
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:12.690
Michael Shannon: Okay, they may be dealing with management with vendors they're there to ensure confidentiality integrity availability authenticity.

93
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.800
Michael Shannon: Non repudiation okay.

94
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.450
Michael Shannon: Technical.

95
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:34.020
Michael Shannon: And then you have officers, where that's where the buck stops usually in an organization when it comes to data and assets, the buck has to stop somewhere right on the yacht it's the captain.

96
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:41.910
Michael Shannon: And organizations, usually some type of executive manager or C suite or cto.

97
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:51.960
Michael Shannon: CIO chief privacy officer CIS oh and, by the way, some of you already.

98
00:16:53.010 --> 00:17:00.210
Michael Shannon: Probably are operating I mean if I was it was many people, as I have in this group today almost 300.

99
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:12.420
Michael Shannon: chances are some of you are already functioning in the role you're already on the CSP to the seating and you're getting the CSP certification.

100
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.490
Michael Shannon: Because, maybe it's mandated you know you see people get hired.

101
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:29.100
Michael Shannon: In these roles and then there's they're like Okay, but I need you to get a your CIS SP and your CSA auditor I see is m within the next period of time, some of you.

102
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:37.440
Michael Shannon: Already in these roles, some of you it's in your future you'll get to see is SP other certifications and you'll go on to be.

103
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:39.900
Michael Shannon: officers.

104
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:55.080
Michael Shannon: We also have a couple of terms due diligence and do care pay due diligence is the act of performing through research.

105
00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:07.890
Michael Shannon: Before you commit to a plan of action okay so remember one of the key differences of due diligence and do care it's kind of similar to change the configuration management.

106
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:20.430
Michael Shannon: Okay, when I describe let's say from an eye till four perspective if i'm explaining changing configuration management well configuration management happens first.

107
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:33.120
Michael Shannon: You have to have an initial baseline configuration without that there's nothing to change now, you can consider that initial configuration, as your first change.

108
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:51.900
Michael Shannon: But you get the point so due diligence is the thing that we do before we do the plan of action, proper information gathering planning reconnaissance workshops Delphi methods planning testing strategy.

109
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.340
Michael Shannon: Right.

110
00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:08.340
Michael Shannon: due diligence is the proper strategy do care is the tactical right do care is ongoing, the ongoing degree of reasonable attention.

111
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:10.800
Michael Shannon: Okay.

112
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.030
Michael Shannon: due diligence to care.

113
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.180
Michael Shannon: Do care activities.

114
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:30.900
Michael Shannon: patch management classic right but from a security manager standpoint, yes, we would, we would like to know that patch management is an aspect of do care.

115
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:40.290
Michael Shannon: And that's true, however, when we get into looking at threat models and security testing.

116
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:51.600
Michael Shannon: As advanced security practitioners we're going to understand at a higher level, just the do care of patch management is not enough.

117
00:19:53.790 --> 00:20:00.300
Michael Shannon: Because if we're not testing the updates in the patches before we deploy them.

118
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.030
Michael Shannon: Is that really do care.

119
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:25.200
Michael Shannon: Just just installing the patch probably doesn't qualify as do care installing a tested patch in a hypervisor environment or a sandbox environment would for most zero trust environments be what do care is.

120
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:35.010
Michael Shannon: Some of you remember, a few months back it was last year, but when the solar winds malware happened.

121
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:46.650
Michael Shannon: There were people that were security operators and security practitioners that were doing do care because they were installing the patch right away.

122
00:20:47.130 --> 00:21:00.510
Michael Shannon: They were up to date on their patch management yay but they didn't test those patches first in a prototypical environment, maybe in a hypervisor environment first and they got burned.

123
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.390
Michael Shannon: To get the malware was in the patch.

124
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.050
Michael Shannon: Now, obviously, solar winds didn't do their.

125
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.120
Michael Shannon: due care.

126
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.650
Michael Shannon: I feel confident.

127
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:32.250
Michael Shannon: That, if you if you approach this exam if you if you truly do have the four to five years of full time experience I feel very confident that after you go through this five days and you find some gaps.

128
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:51.720
Michael Shannon: you're gonna be able to find the right answer it's just gonna it's just going to make sense to you, and some of the questions where it's just not obvious since there's no trick questions that that there should be too obvious distractors.

129
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.320
Michael Shannon: too obvious distractors I just took the.

130
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:22.230
Michael Shannon: This last summer I took the certified cloud security professional, which is isc squares cloud security and the beauty of being a CIS SP is you don't have to you there's no other requirements if you're a CIS SP you can just go take that exam.

131
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.280
Michael Shannon: In fact.

132
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.490
Michael Shannon: I think i'm teaching that again.

133
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:34.830
Michael Shannon: In July.

134
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.010
Michael Shannon: So i'm teaching that CCA SP.

135
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.970
Michael Shannon: The 26th of July it's a three day course I would love for you to go.

136
00:22:49.170 --> 00:23:07.980
Michael Shannon: Past this exam get your ci ssp and then in July come take my three day cloud security boot camp and get that second cloud security because you don't have to have five years of experience working at a cloud provider.

137
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.730
Michael Shannon: and get that on your resume.

138
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:24.030
Michael Shannon: So this summer, when I took that exam and, by the way, that exam is not like CIS SP it's like 125 questions and you're gonna get all the questions.

139
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:39.060
Michael Shannon: And I can tell you, most of those questions were just read purpose CIS SP questions they just changed it to be in a cloud environment or a data Center.

140
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:49.050
Michael Shannon: There were no trick questions and I got I got two questions that I didn't obviously know the answer, but I definitely could get it to a coin flip.

141
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.040
Michael Shannon: I knew it's one of these two.

142
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:55.830
Michael Shannon: So.

143
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:57.840
Michael Shannon: You know.

144
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:05.310
Michael Shannon: For some of you that this is going to be coin flip questions that's Okay, you should be fine.

145
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:18.720
Michael Shannon: So governance is a much more general corporate organizational what drives the ship right it's what steers the Titanic hopefully.

146
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:29.460
Michael Shannon: Getting it to its destination, but the three main attributes or characteristics of governance are some authority.

147
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:54.840
Michael Shannon: Right, the buck has to stop somewhere and governance has the authority to say, this is the direction we're going in or we're going to no longer be a privately held company with venture capitalists owning us but we're going to go public we make those big decisions but we're also accountable.

148
00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:07.740
Michael Shannon: accountable to the venture capitalist accountable to the to the shareholders in the bondholders Okay, but we're concerned with security, governance, our role.

149
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.240
Michael Shannon: In.

150
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.130
Michael Shannon: Protecting.

151
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:22.200
Michael Shannon: The assets and being involved in risk assessment and risk management to lower risk to acceptable levels.

152
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:30.450
Michael Shannon: Based on governance and our value proposition, but it's look again it's wearing the security hat.

153
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.950
Michael Shannon: Now if you're if you're if you're a small to medium sized organization.

154
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:51.870
Michael Shannon: Then, that there may not be a real big separation between corporate governance, I mean I mean, I have a board of directors that are working with the C suite small to medium sized business, you know.

155
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.920
Michael Shannon: you've been at have that type of structure.

156
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:11.850
Michael Shannon: But we're the activities of security, governance, we need to be aware of those there needs to be some type of documented risk register or risk ledger and we're going to talk about what populates that.

157
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:18.180
Michael Shannon: But what's going to populate that initially is any existing.

158
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.160
Michael Shannon: scenarios that we've gone through.

159
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:33.060
Michael Shannon: If you're a startup company that risk ledger risk ledger is going to be based on best practices.

160
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:41.670
Michael Shannon: And are we using co bit five are we using this are we using ISO IEC the risk register is going to be kind of driven by.

161
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:59.940
Michael Shannon: how you are going to implement your your guidelines and your standards, but as you become a more mature organization that risk register starts to get populated with these are actual events and incidents we've gone through, and this is the after action reporting and lessons learned.

162
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:14.130
Michael Shannon: So it it gets continually populated with whatever the results of your risk assessment vulnerability assessment penetration tests all those things will populate that.

163
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:25.260
Michael Shannon: could be spreadsheet driven could be database driven another major activity of security, governance is making sure you're aligned.

164
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:36.180
Michael Shannon: Is alignment with your business or whatever your organization is could be it could be a nonprofit it could be an agency, whatever.

165
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:53.940
Michael Shannon: Making sure that everybody all stakeholders are aware of any compliance or regulatory requirements and that the policies that they must adhere to like acceptable use policies are in line with those requirements.

166
00:27:55.170 --> 00:28:00.960
Michael Shannon: Security government's governance plays a vital role in risk assessment and risk management.

167
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.900
Michael Shannon: Now, usually.

168
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:11.910
Michael Shannon: Your security practitioners or engineers or architects they aren't the sole.

169
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:24.660
Michael Shannon: Entities doing risk assessment and management to small business as possible, but that usually involves you know accountants auditors HR legal.

170
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.520
Michael Shannon: So there's different roles responsibilities that are you know part of that.

171
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:38.160
Michael Shannon: Your insurance company, you know before you get your business policy and your cyber.

172
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:55.890
Michael Shannon: Your cyber attack writer or additional policy it's you know it's very likely that you're working with the teams, they send in to assess your organization before they determine you know what are your premium is going to be.

173
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:06.030
Michael Shannon: tracking and recording documentation all of those things finding out what you can automate is a.

174
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.460
Michael Shannon: Pretty big security, governance activity what things can we automate.

175
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.100
Michael Shannon: Okay.

176
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:27.210
Michael Shannon: So I already mentioned this security, governance, often responsible for publishing.

177
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:38.010
Michael Shannon: and making your stakeholders aware of compliance and regulatory requirements often that's going to drive their acceptable use policies.

178
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.110
Michael Shannon: Privacy policy requirements.

179
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:51.780
Michael Shannon: Now I don't know if these this example from the gdpr I don't know if it's still valid, that may have changed just an example.

180
00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:08.250
Michael Shannon: If you're implementing privacy policies which is kind of a subset of confidentiality you're protecting intellectual property personal information health information you're involved in data loss prevention dlp.

181
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:18.600
Michael Shannon: Maybe assuring adherence to different acts regulations and I put an example there of penalties from the gdpr.

182
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:27.480
Michael Shannon: And what happened with gdpr was the same thing that happened with hipaa now if you ask me.

183
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:41.190
Michael Shannon: And you didn't but do I believe that these huge you know compliance initiatives are they really all about protecting privacy.

184
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:46.740
Michael Shannon: Well, you know what I don't really think, so I think it's more of just a way to.

185
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:58.920
Michael Shannon: it's just a taxation vehicle right hipaa had all these penalties and in the early years they didn't enforce any of them, they gave people time.

186
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.130
Michael Shannon: But then they started to enforce them and there were some pretty hefty.

187
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.230
Michael Shannon: penalties.

188
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.620
Michael Shannon: So here, you can see example of gdpr.

189
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:22.500
Michael Shannon: So your data privacy often due to a mandate that common sense.

190
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:33.000
Michael Shannon: because so many global organizations have become service oriented right kind of the.

191
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:41.340
Michael Shannon: opposite of the Industrial Revolution it's the digital revolution it's the information age.

192
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.180
Michael Shannon: Right our intellectual property.

193
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.510
Michael Shannon: is more and more difficult to protect.

194
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:50.970
Michael Shannon: Now.

195
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:59.880
Michael Shannon: In a way, we'll talk about this, but in a way, part of the solution of protecting data.

196
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.220
Michael Shannon: will be blockchain.

197
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:08.550
Michael Shannon: will be one of the parts of the solution of that but part of our responsibility is going to be.

198
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.800
Michael Shannon: yeah Sebastian Sebastian you're really good question.

199
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:19.740
Michael Shannon: I don't expect to get a lot of specific.

200
00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:41.370
Michael Shannon: Questions about different regulations and mandates like specific hipaa questions or fish or because, like Sebastian saying the CIS SP is a global certification now, am I going to tell you that it's not us centric No, it is.

201
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:54.480
Michael Shannon: it's kind of like I it's kind of like IP version for addressing versus IP version six addressing IP version six address thing is global.

202
00:32:55.530 --> 00:33:02.100
Michael Shannon: But IP version for addresses are still the majority of them are kind of owned by us entities.

203
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:22.140
Michael Shannon: IP version six removes that so the CIS SP exam is not ipv6 yet it's the men, the the mentality and the thinking is us centric but don't expect to see a lot of you know.

204
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:38.460
Michael Shannon: Understand that intellectual property are things like copyrights trademarks, patents formulas trade secrets digital rights information rights licensing cryptographic keys and passwords credit card information so on.

205
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:48.300
Michael Shannon: knots and you know consequences primary and secondary loss, but not so much you know this was an example.

206
00:33:50.040 --> 00:34:00.900
Michael Shannon: This was an example not for you to say Oh, I need to memorize this but understanding that governance and regulations do have penalties.

207
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:23.130
Michael Shannon: that's one of the driving factors behind security and privacy policy is avoiding or evading those types of penalties not you know, the fact that up to the first 10 million euros or whatever that's not The important thing it's conceptually the why.

208
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.070
Michael Shannon: of privacy policy and security, governance, avoiding penalties.

209
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:30.720
Michael Shannon: Right.

210
00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:41.370
Michael Shannon: Always approach it from a security managers point of view so there's you know, the primary inside this is kind of a.

211
00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.020
Michael Shannon: A.

212
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.690
Michael Shannon: Factor analysis of information risk.

213
00:34:49.980 --> 00:35:03.000
Michael Shannon: mentality, fair, which is becoming very, very popular open, fair as a quantitative risk analysis methodology, this is actually kind of borrowed from that.

214
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:14.340
Michael Shannon: Because you've got primary loss let's say to a data breach let's just stick with the whole data privacy thing, so if there's a data breach that.

215
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:25.230
Michael Shannon: First responder and, by the way, this could be something that you discover that the data had been breached or stolen or Expo traded.

216
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:29.280
Michael Shannon: Immediately based on.

217
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:35.010
Michael Shannon: Excellent visibility tools or This is something that you discovered through an audit.

218
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:48.720
Michael Shannon: But regardless there's going to be the alerting of certain first responders and other incident response, people are teams so that's going to be a loss of productivity.

219
00:35:49.560 --> 00:36:02.310
Michael Shannon: And the people that have to respond productivity, the response time that the money to respond to, for example, paying the ransom.

220
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:14.610
Michael Shannon: Because of the ransomware attack and you don't have a proper backup restore snapshots and you're unable to just you know re image, the machines and backup from data.

221
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.340
Michael Shannon: Because remember your backup if you don't go through restoration processes.

222
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:32.880
Michael Shannon: If you don't recover you don't do database recoveries or data restoration, technically speaking, you don't have any backups you can say yeah i've got backup media.

223
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:43.680
Michael Shannon: i've got backup media and i've got i've got a grandfather approach and i've got it stored blah blah blah, and you know this location and it's fireproof you have backup media.

224
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:55.200
Michael Shannon: But unless you've gone through the process of testing and doing restores and recovery you don't really have a backup system, not from a disaster recovery standpoint.

225
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:04.770
Michael Shannon: So replacement, these are all primary you know you found out the compromised insider so they're fired.

226
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:17.280
Michael Shannon: Now you have to replace them and the cost of replacing an employee, the longer they've been there is more than just i'm plugging in a new human being who's getting that same salary.

227
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:27.630
Michael Shannon: know the costs are way beyond just this is a new body getting the same salary replacement costs are much higher.

228
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:38.190
Michael Shannon: Because of just the time to train that person to get them up to speed to get them operating at 100% efficiency or whatever.

229
00:37:38.940 --> 00:38:01.920
Michael Shannon: And then you have secondary losses fines judgments civil cases losing to your competitors your reputation of goodwill, you know borrowing costs the list goes on and what's interesting is primary and secondary has nothing to do with impact or magnitude primary just means initial.

230
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:08.430
Michael Shannon: These are the kind of first immediate loss secondary means they come afterwards.

231
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:15.030
Michael Shannon: As far as impact or magnitude secondary loss can often be much higher.

232
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:21.900
Michael Shannon: Your competitive advantage can be such that now your stock price just plummets.

233
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:33.420
Michael Shannon: So secondary losses because they can be cascading you know lawsuits and judgments can be much higher than just the primary laws.

234
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:52.320
Michael Shannon: The CIS SP exam mentions digital rights management as part of security, governance right you're dealing with copyrighted information, it could be your an organization that has content.

235
00:38:52.980 --> 00:39:02.880
Michael Shannon: That you need to protect you need to protect the rights, the copyrights of your content that's your streaming through you know some.

236
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:19.920
Michael Shannon: akamai or cloud flare or aws cloud front right you're you've got content right, so you had to protect the rights of that content accessing the original right.

237
00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:31.020
Michael Shannon: or you may have to make sure that your organization that your employees are not downloading pirated.

238
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:46.200
Michael Shannon: Content running unlicensed software and a Type two hypervisor right they've downloaded Oracle virtual box and they're running unlicensed software.

239
00:39:47.430 --> 00:40:03.780
Michael Shannon: or you've got privileged insiders who are in the dmz servers and they're downloading pirated DVDs and content so remember we think of digital rights management with a couple of different perspectives.

240
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:19.770
Michael Shannon: Right, are our employees, respecting the digital rights of vendors and providers and partners or and or are we is our value proposition content.

241
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:37.020
Michael Shannon: That has to be a publisher are we are we, the owner of the intellectual property, you know, are we Sony and somebody stole games game of thrones season, whatever and now they're trying to exploit that.

242
00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:52.920
Michael Shannon: And this is going to apply we think of content, like video and audio but another really primary of digital rights management and, by the way the on the cloud exam they call it information rights management I rm.

243
00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:05.670
Michael Shannon: I can't guarantee you that the CIS SP exam is going to be DRM or informational rights management, I would just consider them to be synonymous.

244
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:13.770
Michael Shannon: But for like PDF files you've experienced this right you've gone and you've gotten a PDF file.

245
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:26.970
Michael Shannon: From a some site and maybe you had to pay a lot of money for it, or you had to offer and give them information about yourself, so they can put you on some list to spam you.

246
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:38.220
Michael Shannon: But you did it because you want the PDF file, so they can enforce expiration they can put watermarks on it right, they can you know.

247
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:44.100
Michael Shannon: take away your ability to do a screen capture or print or things like that.

248
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:52.020
Michael Shannon: So it's not when I say content, you know adobe pdfs can you know fall into that category as well.

249
00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:11.910
Michael Shannon: The gdpr and this exam are really big on data minimization okay so data has a life cycle right the first phase of the life cycle is often called the create.

250
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:22.770
Michael Shannon: Now that's a misnomer, but it basically just that's where, for whatever the purpose of the data that's where it begins, yes, it could be something that you create.

251
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:34.830
Michael Shannon: It can be generated by some machine learning tool or algorithm it could be some report that's written, but in that create phase, the data can also be acquired.

252
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:47.040
Michael Shannon: Right you go and you purchase a bunch of sales leads or you go and you get some type of document from gartner or IDC whatever right is that first phase.

253
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:57.390
Michael Shannon: Maybe you're generating data two different tools right same systems are taking it all in and they're creating reports here's the point.

254
00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:17.430
Michael Shannon: GDP ours really big on this, you should only in that phase generate and create and produce data that's meaningful for something just creating mountains of raw data, because you can.

255
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.800
Michael Shannon: is a bad idea.

256
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:30.030
Michael Shannon: it's not a best practice, so we really want to create data with a purpose we generate data with a purpose.

257
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.950
Michael Shannon: In that in those first early phases of the data life cycle.

258
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.730
Michael Shannon: Okay, it should be meaningful.

259
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:53.520
Michael Shannon: And, especially when you think about okay my management V land or whatever tools i'm using if I just create tons of unfiltered logs and I alerts and alarms and.

260
00:43:54.630 --> 00:44:08.040
Michael Shannon: Net flow records vide was producing tons and tons of information that it's just going to be raw data that i'm never gonna make into information that's just more things to be breached.

261
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:16.770
Michael Shannon: that's just more low hanging fruit, not just for privileged insiders but for people that can breach your firewall.

262
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:34.200
Michael Shannon: So you know they're really big on understanding why you need to produce or create data and be specific and only do it for those reasons, only acquire data that you need they're really big on that.

263
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:42.480
Michael Shannon: Now, and then now once you have that mentality, then it's going to involve another other tools.

264
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:53.760
Michael Shannon: right to protect that data obviously encrypting data at rest or roomy send data in transit, you know, using protection mechanisms.

265
00:44:54.450 --> 00:45:05.880
Michael Shannon: To provide confidentiality integrity origin authentication availability all of those things you may even you know, instead of encrypting data, you may token eyes the data.

266
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:16.830
Michael Shannon: Removing data that direct has any directly identifying elements right generating tokens or pseudonyms that are irreversible or non reversible.

267
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:26.820
Michael Shannon: token icing national ID numbers so security numbers other identifying information.

268
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:32.310
Michael Shannon: token ization is often a system.

269
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:40.260
Michael Shannon: Like you have a middle tier token ization server engine and may be done in the cloud like with azure.

270
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:54.150
Michael Shannon: we're going to cover this again in database security that was just an example of saying Okay, once we have a philosophy that the gdpr wants is to have data minimization.

271
00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:05.610
Michael Shannon: Where we really are only producing or creating the raw data that we need to become information and then knowledge.

272
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:19.320
Michael Shannon: Then we have other mechanisms that, by the way, token ization schemes should only be operating on meaningful data.

273
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:39.210
Michael Shannon: As the student asked like Sebastian asked being familiar with the granular aspects of different control frameworks, not so much understanding why we use them in the importance of them definitely.

274
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:55.140
Michael Shannon: But here, this describes some of the attributes and, from a practical standpoint like ISO IEC a lot of Oregon a lot of organizations in certain countries will avoid.

275
00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:17.760
Michael Shannon: ISO IEC and they'll they'll rely upon something that is maybe specific to their country like if you're in the UK, for example, you may for go I, so I see with some other mandate that is specific to your country, because I, so I see is super broad.

276
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.510
Michael Shannon: Massive and it's expensive.

277
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:42.900
Michael Shannon: So it depends on which country you're in okay missed the importance of mist is the fact that is C squared will generate a lot of their their questions from this nist point of view, like I said they're very misty okay.

278
00:47:44.730 --> 00:48:02.430
Michael Shannon: kolbert five is specific remember the is a CA I mentioned earlier, this is the organization that has the CIS M and C is a certification certified information security, a auditor or em manager.

279
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:13.380
Michael Shannon: So they also have the covert five framework but that's why I mentioned to you, you know go find a 2001 CSM book.

280
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:33.660
Michael Shannon: Maybe the highest rated book on whatever site you go to and add that to your reading list for the exam because is a CA is also very misty they come from the same kind of point of view, as the is C squared, but there are others that are you know.

281
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:39.090
Michael Shannon: More more European or other parts of the world right.

282
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:41.070
Michael Shannon: uh.

283
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:48.270
Michael Shannon: don't even ask me to pronounce that Dave could I think dave's a francophone.

284
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:54.180
Michael Shannon: I think everybody, where he lives speaks French to some degree.

285
00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:03.510
Michael Shannon: But there's others like I said don't focus on the granular differences focus on the why security, governance.

286
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.240
Michael Shannon: This is interesting.

287
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:17.640
Michael Shannon: organizations are going to face cyber threats and three main areas now one thing on this exam you will need to be aware of the threat scape.

288
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:35.220
Michael Shannon: Okay, the threat scape but we don't spend like a long I don't spend like an hour on the different types of attacks and things that's like security plus stuff that's like SS CP.

289
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:50.190
Michael Shannon: Or the G SEC from the gic see Those are three of your kind of i've got a year of experience and security certifications security plus it's recommended.

290
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:58.020
Michael Shannon: But you don't have to have a year of experience to get calm to security, plus SS CP.

291
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:12.840
Michael Shannon: Is what some of you may get you may decide I don't really have the work experience so i'll go get the SS CP which needs one year and then, when I get my experience i'll get the CIS SP.

292
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:18.450
Michael Shannon: The gic has the G sack.

293
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:29.640
Michael Shannon: Certification which is one year of experience, you have to go through sands.org point i'm making is those certifications you'll spend.

294
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:39.690
Michael Shannon: A lot of your time on you know what's a worm versus a virus what's a poly morphic worm.

295
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:46.770
Michael Shannon: what's the what's the remote access Trojan we're not going to spend hours doing that.

296
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:48.900
Michael Shannon: Okay.

297
00:50:50.670 --> 00:51:06.240
Michael Shannon: So categorically from a security manager standpoint, I want to know that you know are three areas are disruption right denial of service just distributed denial of service bottom nets ransomware.

298
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:15.480
Michael Shannon: compromising your iot your new thing with has an ipv6 or ipv4 address on it.

299
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:22.290
Michael Shannon: This new thing you got with there was you know this robotic system.

300
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:36.600
Michael Shannon: That they used, you know raspberry pi for the operating system or arduino or something like that, and you haven't fully secured it so they're going to disrupt it with a denial of service attack or distortion.

301
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:51.630
Michael Shannon: You know what's interesting is one of the emerging methods of distortion is to take advantage of your reliance as an organization on machine learning tools and algorithms.

302
00:51:52.230 --> 00:52:03.300
Michael Shannon: Because what happens is this this usually happens whenever some new technology becomes the thing companies implement machine learning tools and algorithms.

303
00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:16.530
Michael Shannon: on site on premise and in the cloud and they rely too heavily on the machine learning or the Ai is results not realizing that that.

304
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:32.400
Michael Shannon: input to the machine learning engine or algorithm can be poisoned and attacker can poison and we're if we're just blindly taking actions based on the results of the Ai and the machine learning.

305
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.820
Michael Shannon: Their their distorting our organization or functionality.

306
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.560
Michael Shannon: deterioration.

307
00:52:47.700 --> 00:53:02.580
Michael Shannon: Breaking down your usage of smart contracts or just deterioration could also be considered the results of an advanced persistent threat can be state based can be a crime syndicate it's a long term.

308
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:11.610
Michael Shannon: You know they have the long view in mind to just slowly deteriorate and compromise your organization.

309
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.760
Michael Shannon: that's deterioration is more what you see with cyber warfare.

310
00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:32.010
Michael Shannon: Yes, we see disruption, yes, we see distortion, but in a state based world wars see that we're in is just the long game of just deterioration of systems.

311
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.410
Michael Shannon: And so, some of the emerging types of cybercrime issues.

312
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:54.690
Michael Shannon: Ai enhanced I mentioned how you, you can poison, but also the malicious software is Ai driven it can adapt quicker than we can respond to it.

313
00:53:55.590 --> 00:54:16.350
Michael Shannon: Ai fuzzing just shoving so much at us to overwhelm our system, Ai fuzzing to accelerate a zero day attack once an organization discovers this 080 day Code as soon as it's discovered the next variant is right behind it.

314
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:23.400
Michael Shannon: already mentioned Trojans and back doors that can poison machine learning tools.

315
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:30.810
Michael Shannon: hacking smart contracts Okay, more and more entities.

316
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:40.920
Michael Shannon: Moving forward new companies new organizations new partnerships are not going to be traditionally.

317
00:54:43.230 --> 00:55:00.120
Michael Shannon: established with a bunch if you think about what it, I mean a corporation or an entity or an llc or a partnership, whatever the business is it's really historically it's really just a bunch of contracts and agreements right.

318
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:14.940
Michael Shannon: You make your company is is a contract and agreement between management and employees vendors customers partners it's a bunch of contracts and agreements.

319
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.460
Michael Shannon: And you know at the state we're in today.

320
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:25.170
Michael Shannon: Many of those are corrupted or there.

321
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:39.960
Michael Shannon: have been taken advantage of dummy corporations, many of them right false front organizations and corporations embezzlement The list goes on and on.

322
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:49.980
Michael Shannon: So smart contracts, a company built that way on a ledger that's distributed that has to have you know some level of.

323
00:55:51.660 --> 00:56:13.170
Michael Shannon: Some methodology for even being able to write to the ledger some consensus agreement on a certain percentage of the parties that type of blockchain mentality will eventually remove a lot of the corruption that is involved in corporate entities, but even those can be hacked.

324
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:21.120
Michael Shannon: A company built an organization built on smart contracts everything's written to a blockchain.

325
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:29.370
Michael Shannon: And cloud computing vulnerabilities which we're going to talk about the CIS SP exam.

326
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:44.250
Michael Shannon: This one that you're studying for there's several areas of technology that have been added over the previous version and versions, one of them is cloud computing.

327
00:56:45.360 --> 00:57:05.760
Michael Shannon: there's a little bit more application and software development, security and there's there's more on mobile mobile devices mobility iot specialty devices Okay, those are areas that you may have to fill in some some gaps on.

328
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:12.240
Michael Shannon: Now this is not they like, I said, they have a dedicated cloud security professional.

329
00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:16.020
Michael Shannon: But.

330
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:26.220
Michael Shannon: You still will get some cloud questions on this exam, this is a, this is not something to memorize but It just shows you as a.

331
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:33.120
Michael Shannon: This was a really big deal to people, which is why we're going to cover cloud security okay.

332
00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:49.170
Michael Shannon: And again, you know these are the biggest cloud security challenges, and this is, you know secure configuration of your workloads and data in the cloud, those are the biggies.

333
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.620
Michael Shannon: So i'm having a hard time.

334
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.700
Michael Shannon: Moving my files alright so.

335
00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:08.190
Michael Shannon: licensing issues.

336
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:17.250
Michael Shannon: Okay, that makes sense, this kind of goes back to the DRM topic or information rights management.

337
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:26.190
Michael Shannon: there's different types of licenses today, though, we see more and more of the click through license which is you.

338
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:35.670
Michael Shannon: When you install the, off the shelf whatever you are agreeing to the license right it's The thing that most of us.

339
00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:50.190
Michael Shannon: Who install software never read coming right, I mean do you do, you always read through every single line of the click through license agreement, maybe you do if you do good for you now.

340
00:58:51.540 --> 00:59:01.530
Michael Shannon: It says, obviously I don't but but on a commercial basis on an enterprise basis, you should be aware of the licensing there's also.

341
00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:09.990
Michael Shannon: licensing that's part of your service level agreements with service providers Those are two very common areas okay.

342
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:14.130
Michael Shannon: let's take a let's take our second break.

343
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:23.250
Michael Shannon: 15 minutes and then we'll come back and we'll have another hour and 15 minutes to finish up our final.

344
00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:44.160
Michael Shannon: set of slides, which is really going to be continuing security, governance but we're going to now get a little bit more granular where our security, governance is going to start to look at policy right policy guidance best practices, those types of things right so i'm going to.

345
00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:49.020
Michael Shannon: By the way, we will talk about token ization again.

346
00:59:51.090 --> 01:00:01.470
Michael Shannon: That slide was in there, just as an example of what you can do with that minimize data we have a whole data security.

347
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:08.430
Michael Shannon: module do you want to call it that Okay, we have a whole data security thing to cover.

348
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:18.210
Michael Shannon: Like I said this first day really is very global very macro okay so i'm going to go and stop the recording.

349
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.880
Michael Shannon: And i'll see you back here in in.

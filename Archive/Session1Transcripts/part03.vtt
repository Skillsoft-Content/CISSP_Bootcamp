1
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.410
Michael Shannon: Hello there and welcome everybody to the CIS SP boot camp.

2
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:50.430
Michael Shannon: It may be early morning, or maybe afternoon, maybe almost Tuesday, for you it's Monday, where I am i'm in Houston Texas.

3
00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:11.760
Michael Shannon: And my name is Michael Shannon and i'm not the only person here this week with you joining us in the background is Dave robichaux dave's gonna be helping out in the chat area in the Q amp a area so it's Mike and Dave this week and, as I said, i'm in Houston Texas David is in.

4
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:29.280
Michael Shannon: Frederick 10 new brunswick Canada so dave's up in Canada i'm down here in Texas, and wherever you wherever you are welcome it's great to have you here in our five day ci ssp boot camp.

5
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.410
Michael Shannon: So before we dive into look at a little bit of the exam real quick and then we're going to get into our content.

6
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.920
Michael Shannon: If you'll notice.

7
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:58.470
Michael Shannon: I on my splash screen here, I have two numbers for CIS SP so little uh I don't know kind of a cautionary tale right, so I got my CIS SP the first time in 2002.

8
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:11.790
Michael Shannon: So 20 years ago pretty much, and it was January of 2002 at that point in time, I had five years of experience in security and it primarily due to hipaa.

9
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.190
Michael Shannon: hipaa security and privacy That was what really gave you my experience doing training and consulting in the phoenix.

10
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:39.210
Michael Shannon: Arizona area scottsdale Arizona area, so I got my CSP the first time 2002 and it was a you know giant envelope Convention Center with the number two pencils and filling in the circles and all that I think it was like six hours.

11
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:50.910
Michael Shannon: Well, things happened and I went through kind of a career change and kind of got away from security altogether and I let my CIS SP sort of vacation laps.

12
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.310
Michael Shannon: And then, so I took it again and I think 2015 so that's my lesson to you once you go through this boot camp.

13
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:17.400
Michael Shannon: And you pass the CIS SP make sure you stay up with your continuing credits over that three year period and pay your dues and don't let that sort of vacation lapse like I did okay so that's my first.

14
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:29.130
Michael Shannon: bit of advice to you, so you will need to be aware of the is C squared code Okay, they have a code of ethics.

15
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.630
Michael Shannon: They also have some other things to be aware of, you probably get one or two questions on Okay, so the first code of ethics.

16
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:45.600
Michael Shannon: Basically, says, you know you're recognizing the getting this certification is a privilege and like I said, you have to first earn it.

17
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.640
Michael Shannon: And then you need to maintain it right, and then you, you know you're admitting to you're going to support the code right so.

18
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:10.740
Michael Shannon: If you intentionally or knowledge knowingly violate in the provision, you may be subject to a peer review and they may revoke your certification so you're also obligated to adhere to the different canons okay.

19
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.610
Michael Shannon: So here's the preamble, the safety and welfare of society and the common good duty to our principles and to each other.

20
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:36.660
Michael Shannon: requires that we had here in the scene do it here to the highest ethical standards of behavior therefore it's strict adherence to the code here's the four cannons this is most likely what you'll see on the exam okay.

21
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:51.480
Michael Shannon: One protect society, the common good necessary public trust and confidence, and of course the infrastructure number to act honorably honestly justly responsibly and legally.

22
00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:04.860
Michael Shannon: Three provide diligent and competent service to principles and for advance and protect the profession, those are the cannons the exam.

23
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:14.700
Michael Shannon: We use a computerized adaptive test for all English exams Okay, so if you're taking it in English three hours.

24
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:30.210
Michael Shannon: And you're going to get mostly multiple choice questions, but you will get what they call advanced innovative like drag and drop type of things or you'll get a topology in the last you to you know fill some things in most of the questions.

25
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:43.320
Michael Shannon: are multiple choice, the passing grade 700 out of 1000 right, and then you have the option of going to attend it depends on where you are going to a testing Center.

26
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:58.020
Michael Shannon: or possibly getting a proctor and taking the exam from home okay that's the cat exam the linear exam is in other languages, and this is actually more.

27
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:09.780
Michael Shannon: along the lines of what i've took in 2002 and two and 2015 it was the CA T type Okay, so if you're taking in some other language, besides English.

28
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.070
Michael Shannon: Then you're gonna have six hours for the exam.

29
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:32.430
Michael Shannon: here's the weightings of the newest CIS SP iteration they really didn't change this hardly at all in 2021.

30
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:46.860
Michael Shannon: But they did add 1% to domain eight so software development, security used to be 9% and they bump that up to 10% okay so.

31
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:57.390
Michael Shannon: And really the CIS SP exam we're going to talk more about this, but they're really testing you from the standpoint of a security manager.

32
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.230
Michael Shannon: Okay, so you will have to wear that security management hat.

33
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:12.690
Michael Shannon: As you're taking this exam which means kind of letting if you're a really experienced network security person or software security person or a database security.

34
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:27.960
Michael Shannon: You kind of have to you know kind of let go a little bit of any bias, you might have and focus on this from a management standpoint, and so what i'll often do is I don't recommend a lot of other books.

35
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:39.540
Michael Shannon: You know you got five PDF files that you're going to be able to download along with this course, that you can watch over and over.

36
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:54.600
Michael Shannon: I would say the pdfs that you download should be your primary study guide, but people often ask you know what's a good other book to get and you know anything you can do.

37
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:03.390
Michael Shannon: That would give you a database of questions, not a not a dump but maybe books to have you know questions in them.

38
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:15.990
Michael Shannon: Because that's part of the The challenge is in these exams, especially the linear exam that's non English six hours is a long time to not.

39
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:30.480
Michael Shannon: Look at your phone you know or check your stock quotes or your cyber currency prices three hours that's still a long time, so you know you need to train your mind and your body.

40
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:39.180
Michael Shannon: For that experience of two and a half to three hours, and I would say it's very likely you're going to go at least two and a half hours.

41
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:48.420
Michael Shannon: of just focusing on one thing, without any distractions and a lot of us that may be a new experience.

42
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:55.350
Michael Shannon: Two and a half to three hours without your phone or your pad or any other type of stimulus.

43
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:14.400
Michael Shannon: So I would say, one of the things you want to make sure that you do is before you take the exam kind of sit down with a one of those you know books, with a bunch of questions in them and just go through the process of sitting down for two and a half hours and answering questions right.

44
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.170
Michael Shannon: And then there's also the is a CA.

45
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.380
Michael Shannon: Has a certified information security manager.

46
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.660
Michael Shannon: certification.

47
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.700
Michael Shannon: So it might not be a bad idea to get the you know.

48
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:41.520
Michael Shannon: The best guide, you can find for the CIA sm because that's a security manager.

49
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:50.460
Michael Shannon: You know type of exam and it and a lot of the content is sourced from the same areas missed.

50
00:09:51.150 --> 00:10:02.550
Michael Shannon: Right ISO IEC type documentation so that's another good you know find the best CSM book, you can find that might be a good companion.

51
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:11.280
Michael Shannon: But if you want to know about other books that are out there, you know Dave is is there on standby to help you.

52
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:26.670
Michael Shannon: There is a another book out there that's think like like it's a CIS is a ci ssp prep book but it's like think like a manager I don't know the exact title of it, maybe some of you out there already have that book.

53
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.870
Michael Shannon: But that might be a good one to get as well right so that's that's our that's the hat we're going to wear.

54
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:47.880
Michael Shannon: and your best approach to this boot camp, because I think we're together, you know we take to it, we eight to 15 minute breaks so that's going to take out 30 minutes so that's you know that's 30 minutes, a day of breaks.

55
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.000
Michael Shannon: So you would only have 18 something hours together right so.

56
00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:14.160
Michael Shannon: Your best approach yeah the 11th hour books not bad, I have that would Victor the 11th hour book but it's truly an 11th hour mean you know I think the best 11th hour book would be the PDF guide but it's not a bad book I have that in a kindle version.

57
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.380
Michael Shannon: So.

58
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:26.610
Michael Shannon: These weightings they they always change, but they don't change by much but uh.

59
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:39.240
Michael Shannon: Hopefully you're not going to wait till 22 the next iteration of this right, hopefully you're going to take they change it every three years right so.

60
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:56.280
Michael Shannon: Hopefully you're going to take this iteration so you should be focusing on, I mean the weightings are important because you technically have to pass enough questions in each domain and, by the way, once you do, that the exam is over.

61
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:07.380
Michael Shannon: Once you satisfy all the domains in the question database you passed and your exams over okay.

62
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:30.480
Michael Shannon: So you know the your best approach really over the next five days is to do a gap analysis right, I mean that the time that you spend with Dave and I, this is not really my the CIS SP boot camp is not really a teacher student relationship at all.

63
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:42.480
Michael Shannon: You know, you should be at least four years into full time security experience paid.

64
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:55.860
Michael Shannon: So this is basically Dave and I, who have this sort of occasion helping out our peers get a certification that they want that we have that's really the approach here.

65
00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:07.020
Michael Shannon: Is that a whole lot of me I mean most of my teaching is just reminding you, and maybe going a little bit deeper some real world examples, but.

66
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:21.690
Michael Shannon: Do a gap analysis find the areas of your weakness or you're where you're not as strong will say it that way and realize those of the areas you would have focused on so that you get those questions in that domain.

67
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.390
Michael Shannon: But you only have to get a 70 out of you know 100.

68
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:38.160
Michael Shannon: that's so doing a gap analysis really is your is your best approach right finding those areas that you need to get stronger in.

69
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:54.090
Michael Shannon: Now, there will be some to some there it is Julio Thank you how to think like a manager for the CIS SP exam that's it by Luke document yeah that's a that's one that a lot of our students, I have recommended.

70
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.060
Michael Shannon: Okay, so obviously.

71
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:10.800
Michael Shannon: The fundamentals there's gonna be some you know filling in those gaps we all, we know that the triad right the security triad which really represents our goals.

72
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:20.220
Michael Shannon: When we go to choose our controls right administrative or managerial controls technical controls physical controls.

73
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:29.580
Michael Shannon: Maybe you'll see them called operational by nist but those controls that we choose, they address these main three goals.

74
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:41.970
Michael Shannon: Confidentiality right protecting you know passwords cryptographic keys personally identifiable information health information intellectual property.

75
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:54.210
Michael Shannon: If you have a class if you have a model, like a mandatory access control model where you have classification or sensitivity levels you're protecting you know sensitive information.

76
00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:05.880
Michael Shannon: Okay sensitive but unclassified secret top secret right that's confidentiality and often we're going to use a cryptographic technique.

77
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:24.960
Michael Shannon: not always Okay, we have ways to create enclaves and compartmentalize for confidentiality, because if we think about high level confidentiality, you know there's a big movement now towards, how do we get confidentiality for data in use.

78
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:39.780
Michael Shannon: You know, we should be very familiar with protecting data in transit right secure Shell other types of encapsulation pls IP SEC I conversion to.

79
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:54.810
Michael Shannon: You know data in transit, and then data at rest usually some mode of as, especially in the United States but data in US that's kind of high level confidentiality.

80
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.520
Michael Shannon: Today, maybe using homomorphic encryption.

81
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.430
Michael Shannon: Which is an algebraic technique.

82
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:27.120
Michael Shannon: Or maybe secure enclave like in your iPhone cloud providers, for example, Amazon web services they have something called aws night row enclaves okay there's no, you know encryption it's just these special secure very difficult to access instances or images.

83
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:39.750
Michael Shannon: So secure compartmentalization or secure enclaves high level confidentiality from a management standpoint right integrity.

84
00:16:40.590 --> 00:17:00.990
Michael Shannon: Fundamentally measures, the attackers ability to manipulate change data address or data in transit, maintaining the integrity and often traditionally to maintain integrity, we would implement a hashed message authentication code right and H MAC.

85
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:18.540
Michael Shannon: sha one shot to shot 384 right and ah MAC which gives us the integrity mechanism in the cryptographic hash but also the MAC or the secret password or key however it's derived.

86
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:31.800
Michael Shannon: That gives us the origin authentication so when we see the CIA triad a does not stand for authentication a stands for of availability.

87
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:44.730
Michael Shannon: Which is one of those areas of security that's a challenge for us as security managers, because we have to maintain we'll talk about that here in a second the a.

88
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.180
Michael Shannon: availability, which may not necessarily be something that we have the kind of control over.

89
00:17:51.990 --> 00:18:10.890
Michael Shannon: As security practitioners and engineers and architects having control over confidentiality mechanisms integrity mechanisms in origin authentication absolutely but high availability sometimes that's the server operators or the server admins or database or network people.

90
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:23.310
Michael Shannon: and integrity is more than just make making sure that data at rest and data in transit aren't modified or changed and unauthorized way.

91
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:34.710
Michael Shannon: But as we're going to find out when we get into mandatory access control models, there are higher levels of integrity, for example, as they work with our zero trust initiative.

92
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:44.880
Michael Shannon: You may have from an administrative standpoint, you may have the ability to modify something, but that doesn't give you the authority.

93
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.560
Michael Shannon: to modify something so we implement higher levels of integrity, like a Clark Wilson model.

94
00:18:53.580 --> 00:19:09.150
Michael Shannon: To make sure that only if you have separation of duties only part of your job duty responsibility, are you allowed to change something even though you may have the highest level of permissions or you may be at a certain sensitivity level.

95
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:19.050
Michael Shannon: You may operate at the top secret level but, according to the model, you may not be able to modify.

96
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:37.170
Michael Shannon: So high level and here's an example of high level integrity, the Clark Wilson model, yes, the first bullet point that's important okay obviously that's kind of like what you know integrity is.

97
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:48.900
Michael Shannon: But higher advanced integrity is ensuring your separation of duties, and this may be, this may be mostly automated.

98
00:19:50.670 --> 00:20:00.630
Michael Shannon: Okay, preventing authorized users from making improper modifications well formed transactions, maintaining consistency.

99
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:11.400
Michael Shannon: That goes beyond just the first bullet point will be commonly think of integrity write a check some or cryptographic hash.

100
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.530
Michael Shannon: And again, the a stands for availability now.

101
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:30.720
Michael Shannon: The aspect that we will for sure, be responsible for when it comes to availability is protecting server systems and distributed systems from denial of service.

102
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:48.240
Michael Shannon: denial of service de dos attacks those types of common attacks that have been around for decades to disrupt the clients ability to get you know, access to something but availability also is a resiliency issue.

103
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:57.120
Michael Shannon: Maybe part of business continuity and like I said as a security practitioner, we may not have our hands on this aspect.

104
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:07.950
Michael Shannon: Right, it may be the network infrastructure people with their active standby fail overs in their clusters of infrastructure devices.

105
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:23.340
Michael Shannon: You know database availability, maybe the database admins, you have the server admins so as security managers, yes, we want to make sure that we have availability and high availability, for example, leveraging.

106
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:33.690
Michael Shannon: A cloud provider that has availability zones in those regions all over the world, and those availability zones are miles and miles apart.

107
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:54.330
Michael Shannon: Their high availability solution is not like you know 911 where there was three buildings that collapsed and their high availability was in one of those other buildings, there was you know meters away or yards away.

108
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.410
Michael Shannon: We don't do that kind of high availability day.

109
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:05.880
Michael Shannon: Right, we want it, we want to make sure that we can that our availability can survive some localized event.

110
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:20.370
Michael Shannon: So we take advantage of different technologies that can stretch a database fabric multiple miles into availability zones, but that's the CIA triad right.

111
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.150
Michael Shannon: High Level availability right.

112
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:34.050
Michael Shannon: You have multiple data centers in a availability zone of the cloud provider, but those zones are 10s or more miles apart.

113
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:49.800
Michael Shannon: Using virtual extended local area networking which theoretically can be stretched up to 800 kilometers 600 miles around that now that's.

114
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.460
Michael Shannon: that's the theoretical limit but.

115
00:22:54.810 --> 00:23:08.670
Michael Shannon: A lot of organizations their high availability solution that most cost effective way to do this now is to use aws Google cloud IBM cloud azure or some other in your country.

116
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:35.850
Michael Shannon: You can also look at CIA from the inverse you know the flip side right disclosure is the opposite of competence reality right the unauthorized revealing or unintentional revealing disclosure a alteration the opposite of integrity D destruction.

117
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:44.370
Michael Shannon: destruction or unauthorized destruction or disposition is obviously an attack on availability.

118
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:48.840
Michael Shannon: So don Parker.

119
00:23:50.040 --> 00:24:08.430
Michael Shannon: He was a senior information systems manager, for a large corporation, so what he did, is he extended the CIA triad to the park carrion heck sad okay well what's the takeaway here really well, the one thing you did.

120
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:21.870
Michael Shannon: That was necessary and obvious was he added authenticity right, so he separated what used to be kind of you know, together.

121
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:36.120
Michael Shannon: Because of using things like ah Max he separated integrity from authenticity that was important, but he also added a couple of other things one utility you know the.

122
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:53.940
Michael Shannon: User usefulness of the asset, because it loses its utility or its value goes down that will affect the types of controls you use Okay, as its value goes down as its utility goes away.

123
00:24:54.690 --> 00:25:05.040
Michael Shannon: That affects the type how you implement controls, he also adds possession in there, so, for example, you can lose possession.

124
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:12.120
Michael Shannon: But still not lose this goal, so, for example, if you have a.

125
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:21.630
Michael Shannon: let's say a a cold storage wallet right with your cyber currency keys on it.

126
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:35.400
Michael Shannon: If somebody is able to steal that but they can't steal the the password aspect to it and then you're 24 words seed phrase, or they can steal a safe or something.

127
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:45.030
Michael Shannon: Maybe it's a full disk encrypted firewire drive they may have possession, but not necessarily you're going to lose confidentiality.

128
00:25:45.750 --> 00:26:06.960
Michael Shannon: Right, so he done Parker added a you know these six elements to it yeah utility i'll give you an example, so, for example, let's say that these slides okay so right now i'm using zoom and I am pushing out.

129
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:09.720
Michael Shannon: You know PowerPoint slides.

130
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:20.460
Michael Shannon: You can't get access to those you can get a PDF i'm giving you a PDF copy, but you don't get the actual PowerPoint slides.

131
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:41.280
Michael Shannon: Now we those are protected, those are in you know stored and those are encrypted, however, when the next course comes out the next iteration of CIS SP I or someone else will have to come in and we'll have to reproduce this course.

132
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:57.300
Michael Shannon: will suddenly the utility of the previous slide deck the value and the need to protect it has gone way down because we're no longer using those slides, we now have a new slide deck for a new course.

133
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:06.330
Michael Shannon: So we could move those to be good either dispose of them are moving to some archival storage, that is cheaper and not as secure.

134
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.360
Michael Shannon: that's probably not a great example but.

135
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.790
Michael Shannon: Think of usefulness, so they added those three okay.

136
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:29.070
Michael Shannon: utility well and assets such as data would be confidential controlled in integral integral authentic and available it's not always useful or valuable in its present form.

137
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:45.660
Michael Shannon: High Level authenticity, this would be will be with call possibly a step up authentication right so higher level authenticity, we think about that you may initially log on to a site.

138
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:54.450
Michael Shannon: Maybe you're going to use some type of you know, single sign on fog or whatever it may be some other type of multi factor authentication.

139
00:27:55.110 --> 00:28:04.950
Michael Shannon: But once you get on to that site let's say an online brokerage firm or where your 401k is or you know your whatever.

140
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:22.320
Michael Shannon: Cyber currency exchange once you do the initial log on of authenticity, if you want to do some other type of transaction like make a withdrawal or make a substantial purchase or whatever they may be additional layers of authenticity.

141
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:41.970
Michael Shannon: Okay additional validation possibly something like a knowledge based authentication right where you'll go through that you have to answer like five questions with information that's in your public record Okay, you know what color was your.

142
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:53.730
Michael Shannon: kiya optima right what county Have you ever lived in or province, have you ever lived in right questions that are part of your public.

143
00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:11.430
Michael Shannon: record, but really only you should know the color of the car you owned right or people or companies you've been associated with and in those five questions they'll there'll be at least one distractors where the answer should be none.

144
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.620
Michael Shannon: So if someone's trying to spoof you they're not going to know that.

145
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:27.810
Michael Shannon: they're going to make a wrong guess so higher level authenticity, which you know we would think of you know, using more stringent biometrics, for example.

146
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:45.360
Michael Shannon: ocular biometrics palm scans things like that So these are all you know security principles that you're expected to be aware of, but not just the basics right you're an experienced security manager for years or more.

147
00:29:47.580 --> 00:30:02.760
Michael Shannon: Non repudiation is often added to the CIA triad yeah you actually often see the CIA n right the ability to refuse or deny that you participated in a transaction.

148
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:12.690
Michael Shannon: A digital transaction a digital contract or some type of email communication okay often non repudiation is going to use a.

149
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:34.170
Michael Shannon: You know, a symmetric key crypto system is going to involve digital signatures when we use digital signatures and one of the most common things that we digitally sign our certificates X 509 v3 certificates remember that's not confidentiality non repudiation you know it offers integrity.

150
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.420
Michael Shannon: or digital signatures offer integrity, they offer.

151
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:48.330
Michael Shannon: Origin authentication non repudiation as security services, but not confidentiality okay.

152
00:30:50.850 --> 00:31:04.470
Michael Shannon: So, believe it or not, this is one of the objectives okay every slide that I have over these five days are from the objectives of the CIS SP exam.

153
00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:12.150
Michael Shannon: So this is one of the things they expect you to know the osi model Okay, from the bottom up, and the top down.

154
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:27.840
Michael Shannon: Do we do we still use this model, not so much okay usually most of the things that we produce are using the Microsoft four layer model.

155
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:42.240
Michael Shannon: that combines layer five through seven into an application layer and it combines layer one and two together, but you know, on the exam you'll need to be familiar.

156
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:52.350
Michael Shannon: With these layers and what happens at these layers i'm not going to go through and teach this right, but you have them these slides in your.

157
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.050
Michael Shannon: pdfs to use as a reference, if you have to fill in the gaps.

158
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:06.630
Michael Shannon: But like I said, you know most often today it's this four layer model that we're using.

159
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:22.050
Michael Shannon: Were the things that were done by the application presentation and session layer are now just the application layer technically speaking ssl pls is a layer five service.

160
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:31.440
Michael Shannon: Okay, whereas obviously IP SEC which isn't on here would be a layer three and layer four.

161
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:48.450
Michael Shannon: So you know, obviously, when you see a protocol, you know, like http with a forward slash s right http forward slash s or you see ftp s you know.

162
00:32:49.110 --> 00:33:07.080
Michael Shannon: What we're talking about is that this layer seven Protocol forward slash over this layer five Protocol The irony is even though we still call it https ftp ftp s we really shouldn't be using ssl anymore.

163
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:15.030
Michael Shannon: Definitely not over the public Internet okay so it's all about transport layer security.

164
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:22.230
Michael Shannon: But there is a four layer model and today if you're doing anything that's you know.

165
00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:36.090
Michael Shannon: Internet related or web enabled usually the developer of the Web application or the service is combining everything that happens from layer five through seven.

166
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.470
Michael Shannon: Okay, in fact, maybe even, in some areas like even layer for.

167
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:51.660
Michael Shannon: More and more on the Internet we're going to be seeing this protocol from Google being used quick.

168
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.790
Michael Shannon: Quick basically does away with tcp.

169
00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:16.950
Michael Shannon: And it uses UDP and it combines basically UDP plus pls plus http next generation, so you know, from a practical standpoint on the Internet we're not there yet, but eventually we'll probably see tcp be like eliminated.

170
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:37.260
Michael Shannon: Generally speaking, replaced with other mechanisms that are going to involve a UDP and then more of the till UDP will be the main transport mechanism and everything else is kind of built in a layer five to seven quick being an example of that, but even the three way handshake.

171
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:55.020
Michael Shannon: If you have a zero trust initiative, where you're using software to find perimeters, for example, it's very possible that using single packet authentication SEPA so you're not even using the tcp handshake so that's kind of you know where we're going.

172
00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.110
Michael Shannon: So I got those slides in there alright.

173
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:10.170
Michael Shannon: So some more principles right we're just kind of making sure we have everything you know, are not just the fundamentals covered.

174
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:20.160
Michael Shannon: But we have to also understand from a experience security manager standpoint higher levels so when I say higher levels of least privilege.

175
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:27.090
Michael Shannon: You should start thinking well we're implementing a zero trust initiative we're getting we're you know we're.

176
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:48.480
Michael Shannon: Getting very granular we were using you know attribute based access, controls, where you are authorized to an authorization profile through some centralized system or proxy or engine based on what you're using Where are you how are you accessing it.

177
00:35:50.160 --> 00:36:00.870
Michael Shannon: So least privilege, is more than just the simple concept of you should only be able to take actions based on what you're authenticated authorized to do.

178
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:08.550
Michael Shannon: Right from a experienced security manager standpoint, you know, we need to think about well, what is the context.

179
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:16.170
Michael Shannon: In you know, in the in what is our identity management, how are we delivering least privilege.

180
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:28.920
Michael Shannon: Or we just simply doing it through our discretionary access, controls in you know, using active directory is that simply what it is, are we going beyond that.

181
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.190
Michael Shannon: we'll talk about those things.

182
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.560
Michael Shannon: So you know, according to nist.

183
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:43.320
Michael Shannon: least privilege and 853 their special publication.

184
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.960
Michael Shannon: They would say it's authorizing access to all security functions for sure.

185
00:36:50.520 --> 00:37:00.090
Michael Shannon: Use non privileged accounts or roles and this kind of goes back to some you know another principle that we've used for you know decades.

186
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:19.830
Michael Shannon: Where you're highly privileged users, also have a non privilege type of account or access so like in windows an active directory, you know you may be a domain administrator or a local administrator, but you have a normal user account.

187
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:36.870
Michael Shannon: that's just a global user and that's the account you use, but when you need to do some type of privilege activity, you will run as administrator and provide some new credential or in Linux you know pseudo into a new context.

188
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.640
Michael Shannon: That has been around you know for a while.

189
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:57.060
Michael Shannon: A non privileged users, they shouldn't be able to execute any privilege functions under the context of their user account, and you know doing heavy auditing massive auditing and visibility.

190
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:09.690
Michael Shannon: ISO IEC 27,001 you know least privileged access to all networks and network services manager managed privileged access rights.

191
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:17.040
Michael Shannon: programs that are you know running vulnerability tools vulnerability assessment tools.

192
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:30.210
Michael Shannon: Access to source code, you know least privileged access to your code repository, whether it be in your data Center or github or a cloud provider.

193
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.470
Michael Shannon: And Dave is exactly right there's no trick questions.

194
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.770
Michael Shannon: Now, you may not agree.

195
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.640
Michael Shannon: Okay, because you're being you're being you're being examined.

196
00:38:48.780 --> 00:39:06.420
Michael Shannon: you're being questioned, a lot of times by by CIS SP question authors, that are not not even more necessarily more experienced than you are they mentioned that they may have nowhere near the real world experience you have.

197
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.190
Michael Shannon: So you have to try to choose sometimes that's the best answer.

198
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.070
Michael Shannon: From the CIS SP point of view, which is always security management.

199
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:27.930
Michael Shannon: And there may be a couple of questions that you get wrong because you just don't agree with their point of view.

200
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.670
Michael Shannon: unlikely, but still not no trick questions.

201
00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.240
Michael Shannon: they're just trying to they're trying to validate.

202
00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:48.720
Michael Shannon: That you have that experience that you claim to have when you go through the process of you know.

203
00:39:50.250 --> 00:40:00.330
Michael Shannon: which you do you know you have to go through a process, you know to be validated, to provide your work experience right, so you have to you know basically.

204
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.910
Michael Shannon: go through and kind of kind of a written interview, but you provide information.

205
00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:13.620
Michael Shannon: they're trying to validate that Okay, on behalf of the global security community.

206
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:30.060
Michael Shannon: Defense in depth, also referred to as layered Defense okay now Defense in depth and layered Defense does tie into a more traditional you know secure the perimeter approach.

207
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:44.040
Michael Shannon: But remember on this exam you're still going to be expected to manage the security of an organization that has more traditionally you know.

208
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:49.080
Michael Shannon: we're securing the perimeter we're securing the edge.

209
00:40:51.240 --> 00:41:00.870
Michael Shannon: What zero trust proponents would call you know the crunchy outside with the gooey Center.

210
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:10.170
Michael Shannon: like an m&m or a skittle right hard outside but kind of chewy inside a chewy Center.

211
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.770
Michael Shannon: that's something that zero trust people.

212
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.760
Michael Shannon: would say we've got to fix that we have to change that.

213
00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:40.530
Michael Shannon: So the question you have to understand is this question under the context of does this environment are they deploying that more traditional type of securing the edge with Defense in depth mechanisms as their primary methodology like a small to medium sized business.

214
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:53.370
Michael Shannon: they're going to focus on, you know their highly available, you know Cisco as a firewalls and intrusion prevention systems and secure.

215
00:41:55.410 --> 00:42:00.780
Michael Shannon: Secure switches and routers and a traditional data Center with a V lance.

216
00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.650
Michael Shannon: Or are you.

217
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:14.700
Michael Shannon: Securing a data Center with VX land and highly virtual with hypervisor clusters and.

218
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:21.240
Michael Shannon: You know storage area networking, it depends on the context of the question.

219
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:40.920
Michael Shannon: So Defense in depth or layered Defense can be physical because you can even think of you know, a physical of a campus having physical Defense in depth wherever your property line is with your finances, of whatever type and height.

220
00:42:41.940 --> 00:43:01.860
Michael Shannon: Electric not electric barbed wire no barbed wire gates security guards, all the way back to the keep whatever, that is, can be a safe a walk in safe, it could be the network operations Center the data Center whatever Defense in depth can be physical.

221
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:20.460
Michael Shannon: It can also be technical right you've got an edge router that's doing network address translation some security services like an infrastructure apple but behind that you have a firewall firewall system, maybe you have a honey net.

222
00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:41.070
Michael Shannon: You set up you've got security on you have maybe an inline ips sensor maybe it's part of the firewall so the Defense in depth can be technical the Trolls and it can be completely logical if you have an all in one firewall appliance from Palo Alto or somewhere like that.

223
00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:55.320
Michael Shannon: The Defense in depth, is being done as your engines in that all in one appliance act on the data grams of the packets that are flowing through that layer three device.

224
00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:09.330
Michael Shannon: And they're probably not a hop they could be, you know that layer three device could be participating in a dynamic routing protocol, and it could you know deprecate the.

225
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:19.440
Michael Shannon: Time delivery field and the IP header or it can be more transparent, but regardless it's just a single appliance and there's Defense in depth.

226
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:34.500
Michael Shannon: Do you have the infrastructure actual the firewall rules, maybe you have an ips sensor it's integrated or it's a modular components, maybe you're communicating with some email security appliance or web security appliance or the cloud.

227
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:45.930
Michael Shannon: But you've got Defense in depth, but it's all done logically as that packet reverses that one device.

228
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.150
Michael Shannon: we're starting to see Defense in depth.

229
00:44:52.200 --> 00:45:04.620
Michael Shannon: Analysis really come into play, over the last couple of years because of the risks we've seen at the supply chain, or the disruptions massive disruptions to the supply chain.

230
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.190
Michael Shannon: So layered security again.

231
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.160
Michael Shannon: Lots of ways to approach it.

232
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:27.150
Michael Shannon: Again, the really the trend is to not just depend on our perimeter security edge security.

233
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:48.090
Michael Shannon: And that's a transition some companies take longer to transition than others Cisco you know, which is what my experiences in since the 90s, I was, I was a Cisco instructor CC NP for several different things.

234
00:45:50.640 --> 00:46:02.610
Michael Shannon: You know, sometimes because of their the nature of their acquisitions of hardware and companies there and as they aren't as agile or nimble as other companies.

235
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:20.610
Michael Shannon: Okay, so sometimes they kind of cling to their interface based firewalls too long before they go zone based or they cling to you know edge security before they kind of you know, get on board with a zero trust initiative.

236
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:26.790
Michael Shannon: So here's kind of a more traditional.

237
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:38.160
Michael Shannon: perimeter security is this is, these are technical controls okay So these are going to be in your slide deck a couple of times.

238
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:58.710
Michael Shannon: DHS Einstein, by the way, that is a that's a this this diagram comes from the Department of Homeland Security in the US and i'm not even sure that Einstein programs going on, but this is a really good example of kind of traditional.

239
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:00.720
Michael Shannon: controls.

240
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:07.440
Michael Shannon: So I put you want to be familiar make sure that you're familiar with all these different terms.

241
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:11.550
Michael Shannon: As part of your gap analysis okay.

242
00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:13.770
Michael Shannon: uh.

243
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:22.380
Michael Shannon: You, for example, US gcb compliance that's the United States Government configuration baseline.

244
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:33.120
Michael Shannon: used to be called something else and security baselines whether they're do D or Center for security CIS, those are important.

245
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.820
Michael Shannon: Application security which we're going to talk about 10% of the exam.

246
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.310
Michael Shannon: data security.

247
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:51.300
Michael Shannon: dlp we know that's data loss prevention or data leakage prevention da R is data at rest.

248
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.760
Michael Shannon: And then you've got.

249
00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:01.770
Michael Shannon: management policy manager will cover these areas and monitoring your response.

250
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:08.910
Michael Shannon: Which is going to include you know seem systems source systems, often working together.

251
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:19.680
Michael Shannon: If you want to see an example of semen source systems, working together, you know go check out something like as your Sentinel which is cloud based.

252
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.700
Michael Shannon: So I put those in there for you.

253
00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:45.180
Michael Shannon: Another principle and, by the way we take two breaks okay to 15 minute breaks every session so our first break will be 15 minutes after the next hour so we've got 25 more minutes okay.

254
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:58.260
Michael Shannon: If you need to take a break before then remember this is being recorded but also we're kind of you know, covering some foundational topics, but our first break will be 15 minutes after the hour.

255
00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:13.050
Michael Shannon: separation or segregation of duties Okay, this is a very important aspect that's that takes least privilege to another level, it takes the integrity to another level okay.

256
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:33.540
Michael Shannon: Separation of duties, could be a dual operator scenario where you have to have at least two people per service or system or function Okay, but it could also be a very strict partitioning of your responsibilities and your roles, for example, if you work at a cloud provider data Center.

257
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:47.250
Michael Shannon: it's very rare there's there's only a small group of people that have access to every area of the data Center Okay, you may be isolated to the security operations Center.

258
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:56.670
Michael Shannon: If you have a separate knock and a separate suck network operations, you may be, I may be isolated there okay so.

259
00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:15.870
Michael Shannon: Other things that tie into segregation or separation of duties and it will be give you the kind of classic example where the people that do the database backups and create the snapshots a different group does the restoration right that's kind of a classic separation of duties.

260
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:25.290
Michael Shannon: model it talk about maybe two signatures, maybe multiple cryptographic keys for certain activities.

261
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:37.800
Michael Shannon: Also rotation of duties can be another principle that's it's put in there, where you rotate out of a particular role or responsibility on a regular basis.

262
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:48.120
Michael Shannon: And that is for a couple of reasons, one to this note, you don't have a single point of failure as from a personnel standpoint but you don't really want to have.

263
00:50:48.540 --> 00:51:02.370
Michael Shannon: Right continuity of operations or business continuity planning, you want to try to as part of bcp if you have too many individuals who are the only people that know how this works.

264
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:15.600
Michael Shannon: or know how to run this system or application that's not a good thing for continuity of operations for sure, but rotation of duties is also done so that especially to hire privileged.

265
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:34.770
Michael Shannon: Employees and specialist so once you rotate them out you're going to audit them and it's also if they know they can be rotated out and they don't know when maybe there's their least likely to engage in unauthorized or illegal activities right.

266
00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:49.890
Michael Shannon: Or you know mandatory vacations right if you have a you take a two week vacation you have to take that two week vacation you do not come back into the Office for two weeks now, some of us.

267
00:51:51.270 --> 00:52:06.660
Michael Shannon: haven't been into the Office for years right I haven't i've been working remotely from this company I haven't seen my co workers in I guess it'll be almost three years.

268
00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:17.580
Michael Shannon: We haven't been able to have you know, a summit, or you know, one of those times, where we all get together in Boston.

269
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.100
Michael Shannon: it's been a long time.

270
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.630
Michael Shannon: Keep it simple okay.

271
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.410
Michael Shannon: You make things too complex.

272
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:37.530
Michael Shannon: Then you may have the you know opposite result.

273
00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:48.540
Michael Shannon: Okay, you need to find a delicate balance because remember you are obligated to understand how your business functions.

274
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:51.420
Michael Shannon: You have to contribute.

275
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:56.610
Michael Shannon: by securing, whatever your value proposition is.

276
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:07.470
Michael Shannon: Whatever your product or service you're participating in securing the process of developing that or manufacturing that or whatever.

277
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.980
Michael Shannon: So there's a delicate balance between creating a secure environment and.

278
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:22.560
Michael Shannon: affecting productivity or output or negatively affecting the delivery of the value proposition.

279
00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:24.270
Michael Shannon: Okay.

280
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:39.240
Michael Shannon: And examples this you know your password policy and hopefully you're going to be getting away from passwords eventually all together right when we will be using biometrics.

281
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.930
Michael Shannon: tokens qr codes.

282
00:53:44.700 --> 00:54:03.240
Michael Shannon: Hopefully, with some type of centralized database or centralized engine, we can call it an access control proxy like Google uses with an inventory engine for their you know attribute based access control plus their you know.

283
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:08.490
Michael Shannon: Their their zero trust initiative which is called beyond corp.

284
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:13.140
Michael Shannon: You know they they're moving beyond passwords.

285
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:23.940
Michael Shannon: And so you know, three words that are unrelated separated by dots or dashes that's actually more.

286
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:31.230
Michael Shannon: Strong it's stronger than the one below it this looks like it would be stronger.

287
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:37.740
Michael Shannon: But technically it's not and also the things that we add to our.

288
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:48.090
Michael Shannon: passwords the substitutions that we make you know the at symbol for an A the five for an s.

289
00:54:49.710 --> 00:55:02.520
Michael Shannon: The exclamation point for something those aren't as those aren't as clever as we think they are those are already in downloadable databases corporate.

290
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:14.280
Michael Shannon: systems that have been hacked and those passwords that use a lot of substitutions those are already in loanable files that we can use with you know are cracking tools.

291
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.070
Michael Shannon: i've already mentioned zero trust a couple of times.

292
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.670
Michael Shannon: A an evolving paradigm.

293
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.730
Michael Shannon: Moving away from edge and perimeter security.

294
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.060
Michael Shannon: To tackle the chewy Center.

295
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:41.160
Michael Shannon: The chewy Center is those compromised privileged insiders are number one threat.

296
00:55:42.450 --> 00:56:01.320
Michael Shannon: The number one threat to your organization is the compromised privileged insider some people call them disgruntled I don't like to use that term because you can you can love your company, you can love your boss, you can love the department you work in.

297
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:03.210
Michael Shannon: Love my job.

298
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:20.340
Michael Shannon: You cannot be disgruntled, but you can be compromised financially compromised gambling problem drug problem someone's trying to extort you the list goes on your disgruntled but you might be desperate.

299
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:34.200
Michael Shannon: And compromised, so those that's your chewy Center the zero trust is involved in no trust trust no entity trust, no one.

300
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:49.140
Michael Shannon: And all of the different variations of their access must be monitored must have total visibility, as well as the objects, are the assets that they can access and the changes to those assets.

301
00:56:51.210 --> 00:57:03.030
Michael Shannon: No implicit trust just because you're behind the firewall and this definitely as For those of you who have deployed firewalls i'm sure many of you have.

302
00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:17.700
Michael Shannon: Just look at the the the nomenclature or look at the verbiage, we use to describe our zones here's the trusted zone here's the untrusted zone here's the dmz.

303
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.150
Michael Shannon: Was zero trust there is no trusted zone.

304
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:39.690
Michael Shannon: authentication authorization distinct tasks before the session is established and, by the way, in fact, that security session, you should be moving away from vpn technology.

305
00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:50.220
Michael Shannon: Google and if you ever go half the time you can go look at their beyond corp they're the ones that really you know.

306
00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:52.980
Michael Shannon: really lead the way.

307
00:57:54.300 --> 00:58:04.710
Michael Shannon: Yes, it's been around for several years, but they started to implement this and, like I think 2015 and it was like a you know they knew is gonna take a long time.

308
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.120
Michael Shannon: So beyond corp is there was their initiative.

309
00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:21.600
Michael Shannon: Rarely, does it does a Google employee use a vpn it's only if you know absolutely necessary because of where they're located and their job duty.

310
00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:33.690
Michael Shannon: Micro segmentation is more from approaching a zero trust initiative from an application and a software security standpoint.

311
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.060
Michael Shannon: But.

312
00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:50.760
Michael Shannon: For example, Google they don't use vpn they don't have vpn clients installed or agents like you know Dave and I, we have a corporate laptop, but we have the Cisco any connect mobility client.

313
00:58:51.390 --> 00:59:05.070
Michael Shannon: If you work for Google, you have a provisioned device and you're using chrome with a special add on which is part of your software defined perimeter and that add on is communicating with the controller.

314
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:07.290
Michael Shannon: In the cloud.

315
00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:11.850
Michael Shannon: So this is a very important initiative.

316
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.080
Michael Shannon: And it is you know to be defined on the exam.

317
00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:30.570
Michael Shannon: This I put some diagrams in here, you know, to help you, you know with zero trust its identity management, and it goes beyond just what is my source IP address.

318
00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:42.120
Michael Shannon: Okay, you are authenticating and authorizing every session, and so in a zero trust architecture, let me give you an example.

319
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:57.030
Michael Shannon: If you were using a cloud provider like aws or Google cloud, yes, you could go up to that cloud provider and you could use their iam service, where you would create groups.

320
00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:13.350
Michael Shannon: And you would create users and those users forget certain permissions and they're usually json documents that say, these are the persistent permissions I have to cloud resources, you can do that.

321
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:28.830
Michael Shannon: But those persistent types of permissions and access to the cloud or access keys that I use programmatically those types of methodologies are not zero trust.

322
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:47.310
Michael Shannon: Those are persistent keys I have those are persistent permissions that I have that have compromised, whoever compromises those now they have those persistent zero trust is more session based so you're using assertions and tokens.

323
01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:53.190
Michael Shannon: Your access is not persistent it's session based.

324
01:00:54.630 --> 01:01:15.300
Michael Shannon: preferably in a federated environment saml two point o o IDC and oh off those types of scenarios and the big the big user at the bottom automating as much as possible and visibility and continual analytics.

325
01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:29.340
Michael Shannon: And also part of zero trust is when you look at the fact that you have subjects and objects, not only do you understand the attributes of the subject, and they can change.

326
01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:41.940
Michael Shannon: So it's highly built on attribute based access, controls, what are they using where are they, why are they doing this, what is what are they accessing what time are they accessing it.

327
01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:52.860
Michael Shannon: From where those attributes, but also the the objects that they're accessing that posture can change constantly.

328
01:01:53.670 --> 01:02:14.880
Michael Shannon: and needs to be updated upgraded, it is a service pack, it needs a hot fix these just security update so an inventory system that is integrated with your access control system, because the subject can be in a different scenario different variables, but the objects change.

329
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:28.110
Michael Shannon: And, especially if the object is like code and you're using agile or ci CD the Code, the object that could be changing several times a day.

330
01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:32.580
Michael Shannon: So zero trust involves.

331
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:56.220
Michael Shannon: Massive visibility into those that relationship and that the relationship between the the subject The object is session based preferably not a persistent type of access and preferably not using traditional vpn technology which is.

332
01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:58.860
Michael Shannon: highly suspect.

333
01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:17.610
Michael Shannon: Then there's we'll talk more about this when we get to application security secure by design secure by deployment secure by default well right now the takeaway here is secure by deployment is the is the least optimal.

334
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:39.270
Michael Shannon: it's the least optimal saying that I am not securing this APP or application or whatever by design or by default, but i'm i'm deploying it into a secure environment that's the least optimal and, by the way, that is what many organizations have relied upon.

335
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.290
Michael Shannon: i've got a you know i've got a I got a firewall so I have a secure environment.

336
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.410
Michael Shannon: i've got you know private V lance.

337
01:03:54.420 --> 01:04:04.890
Michael Shannon: So secure defaults the existing default configuration settings are the most secure possible you know another aspect of zero trust.

338
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:17.310
Michael Shannon: Is the fact that the days of me connecting to infrastructure devices, whether you whether i'm using an out of band method on a serial port.

339
01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:34.470
Michael Shannon: Or whether i'm using some centralized access with a management V land and i'm directly connecting to devices secure Shell and doing configuration from some console or management station those days are going away and we'll talk about.

340
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:40.530
Michael Shannon: You know, a big part of of zero trust is using is using a.

341
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:55.770
Michael Shannon: relatively new software defined networking, which means I am securely with multifactor authentication logging onto a controller, and the controller, is sending API.

342
01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:07.320
Michael Shannon: Calls or request to the to the devices to the infrastructure i'm not connecting to those devices to do management access or administer them anymore.

343
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:15.870
Michael Shannon: I security log on to a cluster of controllers and from there, I use infrastructure as code.

344
01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:25.290
Michael Shannon: Secure configurations secure API calls to the to the devices in the infrastructure.

345
01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:28.620
Michael Shannon: Okay.

346
01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:48.630
Michael Shannon: So an example, you might want to look up is microsoft's as your security default just an example, this exam, even though I do mention things like azure or Cisco or aws or Google the exam is vendor neutral.

347
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.300
Michael Shannon: it's vendor neutral.

348
01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:52.980
Michael Shannon: Okay.

349
01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:15.030
Michael Shannon: Failing securely implementing a mode of system termination or functions that prevents any loss of your secure state when there's a crash or a failure or some type of reboot.

350
01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:31.260
Michael Shannon: Okay attackers and this also ties into zero trust often another aspect of zero trust is moving security from the application, down to the system, the the the board.

351
01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.770
Michael Shannon: Right trusted platform modules.

352
01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.160
Michael Shannon: Even you're starting to see what's called micro hsm.

353
01:06:42.870 --> 01:07:00.240
Michael Shannon: On little memory cards hardware security modules running off of little memory cards, but attackers should not be able to get any type of access, during a failure state of a server or a system.

354
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.720
Michael Shannon: Failing securely.

355
01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.110
Michael Shannon: When you.

356
01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:13.680
Michael Shannon: deploy failure undo changes or rollbacks to a secure state.

357
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:22.410
Michael Shannon: You must maintain availability confidentiality and integrity at all states of the system.

358
01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:35.880
Michael Shannon: and moving security keys and passwords and and certificates down to the hardware level can be very beneficial.

359
01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:40.260
Michael Shannon: This is really a misnamed slide.

360
01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:45.690
Michael Shannon: Okay, with fail, open and fail close, let me just remove that.

361
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.930
Michael Shannon: I meant to do that in my last class let's just talk about this concept.

362
01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.740
Michael Shannon: fail, open and fail closed.

363
01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:01.830
Michael Shannon: This is more traditionally something that you would implement.

364
01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.340
Michael Shannon: And there is an element of this on a firewall, but it really has to do with.

365
01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:27.240
Michael Shannon: Different monitoring services like CES log sending CES log traps, I want to talk about this from the standpoint of an inline ips okay intrusion prevention systems so traditionally whether the ips is a standalone sensor.

366
01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:47.370
Michael Shannon: That is behind a firewall which it could be, it could be running in an operating system, it could be running as a modular components chassis whatever logically the ips the in line ips system is logically behind the firewall.

367
01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:58.710
Michael Shannon: But the firewall has to act on the packets, and my IP a sensor, which is in line should only be acting on data grams that have.

368
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.520
Michael Shannon: gone through the firewall process.

369
01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:14.850
Michael Shannon: The only I wouldn't really ever imagine deploying an ips sensor in front of a firewall now maybe an ids a detection service.

370
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:36.330
Michael Shannon: To kind of see how you're being attacked, or maybe on a honey net without an inline sensor so you can deploy and in line ips sensor and fail open or fail closed right simply if some component or some part of the the ips sensor fails.

371
01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:58.650
Michael Shannon: I still want traffic to flow okay I don't consider the ips has zero Lee a mission Critical Infrastructure device I have other methods, I have other visibility tools i'll react so if if the device fails keep the traffic flowing fail closed is.

372
01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:07.320
Michael Shannon: If the for some reason, something fails on the sensor do not allow traffic to flow through the inline device.

373
01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:30.030
Michael Shannon: And there's some firewalls and other devices, they can also be configured in such a way, for example, if I no longer sending you know SIS logs or SNP traps or informs I want to not allow traffic to flow, but I think the the ips sensors a better example of this.

374
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:35.010
Michael Shannon: Alright, so privacy of.

375
01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:38.850
Michael Shannon: We don't my privacy privacy.

376
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:53.880
Michael Shannon: really is from a management standpoint, a subset of confidentiality, but not synonymous, because privacy really is focused usually on data sensitive data.

377
01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:07.350
Michael Shannon: You know, intellectual property personal information health information corporate secrets things like that, where confidentiality is a much larger you know umbrella term.

378
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:10.920
Michael Shannon: So.

379
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:32.910
Michael Shannon: Is C squared the organization that does this, as we talked about in the very beginning, they are very nifty okay misty means they you know they get a lot of their content from the National Institute of standards of technology.

380
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:37.230
Michael Shannon: And their frameworks okay.

381
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:48.690
Michael Shannon: Privacy by design you take privacy into account when you design applications or systems or you develop services.

382
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:56.310
Michael Shannon: realizing that data may be in other geographic areas.

383
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:01.590
Michael Shannon: So gee you know how subject are you to gdpr.

384
01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:17.940
Michael Shannon: Now the gdpr topic, if it comes up is tricky Okay, you have to think of the gdpr and it involves not just EU and things that are under the EU umbrella.

385
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:38.940
Michael Shannon: Because the EU is also like the United States, because we have like protectorates right they're not states, but you know we have Puerto Rico and guam they're not states but they're kind of so EU as like protectorates as well, but it's also if you do business with the EU.

386
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.960
Michael Shannon: Well, this is one of those areas that you have to think about well when this when this exam was written.

387
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:52.620
Michael Shannon: So that so I doubt there's gonna be specific questions about gdpr.

388
01:12:54.420 --> 01:13:08.970
Michael Shannon: Because it's gone through different you know, based on what the EU judges, say, because I think I think March, I think, just a few weeks ago, in March, the US just kind of.

389
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:13.740
Michael Shannon: Had a new agreement trans borders some agreement.

390
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.840
Michael Shannon: Okay.

391
01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:24.450
Michael Shannon: i'm pretty sure, like the 25th so that this is a kind of an organic thing don't get too hung up on, you know.

392
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:30.300
Michael Shannon: The the you know granular aspects of gdpr things like that.

393
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:42.480
Michael Shannon: Coming communication to all of your employees, so they understand you know their role, but not just communication, but acceptable use policies that are enforced Those are all important principles.

394
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:57.570
Michael Shannon: This concept of trust, but verify this is going away, this is what we used for years, when we made sure that the corporate edge was secure.

395
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:11.940
Michael Shannon: We had a secure edge as much as possible and within the organization within our local area networks and our extra nets and partner nets and vpn trust, but verify.

396
01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:24.870
Michael Shannon: And that could involve you know simple SMS messages or whatever, but this trust, but verify concept, we are in an evolution of getting away from this.

397
01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:30.900
Michael Shannon: Is trust, but verify is not zero trust it's what we've done traditionally.

398
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:33.480
Michael Shannon: Trust but verify.

399
01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:49.050
Michael Shannon: But still a valid approach that many organizations are using okay so we'll take our first break we come back we're going to kind of change topics here we're going to look at.

400
01:14:50.640 --> 01:15:03.240
Michael Shannon: security, governance and this is, you know this first day is really kind of a big picture day right security, governance we're going to cover we're going to look at some policy.

401
01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:14.760
Michael Shannon: we're going to cover today, so you know it kind of it's kind of a big picture day as opposed to getting too specific building that.

402
01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.250
Michael Shannon: You know foundation.

403
01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:27.060
Michael Shannon: So let's take a break i'm going to stop the recording because you don't want a 15 minute break on your recording so i'm going to stop the recording.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.320
Michael Shannon: Welcome back everybody it's day three session three of the CIS SP boot camp with Mike and Dave.

2
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.600
Michael Shannon: good to have you back.

3
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.930
Michael Shannon: we're going to be on in the PDF to answer the question about the slide number.

4
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.200
Michael Shannon: we're going to be on.

5
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.200
Michael Shannon: 141.

6
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.980
Michael Shannon: Of the session two slides so we're still in the session two slides that's okay.

7
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.850
Michael Shannon: I may give you a reading assignment today.

8
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:26.130
Michael Shannon: Is 163 slides in session three is a big section on physical security.

9
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.960
Michael Shannon: physical security is not a standalone domain used to be way back in the day they used to be a cryptography domain, a physical security domain.

10
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:48.660
Michael Shannon: So there's quite a bit of content on physical security physical security is one of those areas that's probably the going to be the easiest questions because all of us have experience.

11
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.870
Michael Shannon: You know, one way or another, with all different types of physical security mechanisms so we'll see we'll see how it goes.

12
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.510
Michael Shannon: So some folks are having an issue with audio.

13
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.490
Michael Shannon: sounds like.

14
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.830
Michael Shannon: Dave you're going to be on that for me thank you all right.

15
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.100
Michael Shannon: let's go ahead and we need to dive in.

16
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.730
Michael Shannon: and continue our discussion from yesterday.

17
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:40.980
Michael Shannon: We were looking at a mandatory access control system or model, all of them are based on this original mathematical bell lapa doula multi level security model.

18
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:55.560
Michael Shannon: used by military government agencies government contractors high security environments it's a state machine model and state machine basically means you not only understand.

19
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:06.570
Michael Shannon: All the subjects and all of the objects, but all of the States and the transitions of States between this subject and object.

20
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.720
Michael Shannon: Talk about let's say a an agency with assets files, for example, whether they're physical or logical.

21
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:32.910
Michael Shannon: You know chain of custody is not just something we see in a parenthetic environment and a mandatory access control environment internally, you need to maintain a strict chain of custody and understanding the state.

22
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:43.830
Michael Shannon: bell up a doula has several rules it stresses confidentiality Okay, we have a different model that stresses integrity.

23
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.700
Michael Shannon: And it's based on the security board or the committee as to how this mandatory access control model is.

24
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.860
Michael Shannon: implemented.

25
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:06.540
Michael Shannon: Now, if we look at a movie let's say the bourne identity right one of those bourne movies Jason bourne.

26
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.350
Michael Shannon: matt damon playing Jason bourne.

27
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.630
Michael Shannon: And the.

28
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.630
Michael Shannon: agent pamela landy.

29
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:40.080
Michael Shannon: that's not a strict MAC model in the movie pamela landy needs to get access to the tread stone files or the black briar files whatever it's called and the director gives her access or somebody at a higher level assistant director gives her access to those files unreactive.

30
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:53.490
Michael Shannon: that's not very realistic and as trick bell up a doula rule set you've got usually rules that you abide by the simple security rule is pamela landy.

31
00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:06.300
Michael Shannon: At a given security level secret will say cannot read data that resides at the top secret or a higher security level no read up.

32
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.520
Michael Shannon: Okay that's the simple security rule that most of MAC models are going to use.

33
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.040
Michael Shannon: So that right there.

34
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:30.330
Michael Shannon: violates what the movie does in a strict MAC model in the movie pamela landy would have to go through the rigorous process of being promoted.

35
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:46.440
Michael Shannon: To a higher sensitivity level a higher classification level in order to read the files at her level there's also a strong star property and we say star, you know asterisk.

36
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:59.430
Michael Shannon: A subject pamela landy who has read and write capabilities can only perform those at the same security level nothing higher nothing lower even.

37
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:10.650
Michael Shannon: Strong star property, the star property rule basically says pamela landy at the secret level cannot write information to the lower level.

38
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:26.160
Michael Shannon: So there's the star property there's the strong star, the reason why we don't want her to interfere with the lower level, even though she's a higher level is you're interfering with what's happening at that lower level.

39
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:42.150
Michael Shannon: tranquility principle subjects and objects cannot change their security levels once they've been instantiated or created so you just can't on an ad hoc basis.

40
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:55.680
Michael Shannon: Change pamela landis' level from secret to top secret, there is a established promotion process, which includes additional more stringent background checks and so on.

41
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:07.320
Michael Shannon: Now there is an optional discretionary security property and that's what you see in the movie you see this optional discretionary security property.

42
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:23.310
Michael Shannon: Which is not like discretionary access Okay, because pamela landy doesn't own something is something in the owner of the tread stone filed it doesn't get to say hey i'm the owner of this file and i'm going to allow pamela landy to read it.

43
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:30.870
Michael Shannon: The discretionary model if a subject like the director or a committee.

44
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:44.430
Michael Shannon: has a certain type of access, they can grant or transfer certain rights so in the movie they're in they're deploying the discretionary security property by allowing.

45
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:56.940
Michael Shannon: pamela landy to access those particular files now normally they would be not the originals it would be a copy of those files that are redacted in some way, but you get the idea.

46
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:07.260
Michael Shannon: This is a strict model that's used, you know military environments government intelligence agencies contractors and so on.

47
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:21.630
Michael Shannon: bibs is an integrity model and it came after bell up a doula and it also has a lattice of integrity levels, a lattice of integrity levels that's not the way bill up a doula works.

48
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.840
Michael Shannon: And if you know what a lattice is it basically you've got some property.

49
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.210
Michael Shannon: And it's.

50
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.020
Michael Shannon: sharing with the level below it and a level above it and the lattice.

51
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:44.430
Michael Shannon: A matrix so it's got rules, the simple integrity rule you can't read down.

52
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:58.320
Michael Shannon: can't read down can't write up and you can't call upon a subject at a higher integrity level can't even make a request.

53
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:13.590
Michael Shannon: And it's just also a state machine model but it's also an information flow model so mandatory access control models understand the every state every transition of the state, they also.

54
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.210
Michael Shannon: have information flow rules.

55
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:39.210
Michael Shannon: And like I said, they also maintain internal chain of custody and information flow model might look something like this okay so let's say this is just a loose analogy, and he would set up some kind of matrix for this, but let's say a was believes my company, for example.

56
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:50.670
Michael Shannon: So let's say a is the Ireland office, so let me, let me get my non vanishing pin So this is the a is the Ireland office.

57
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.810
Michael Shannon: i'll be I RD.

58
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.730
Michael Shannon: Is the Ireland office see is where.

59
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:09.150
Michael Shannon: David is we'll just put Fred because he's in Frederick in new brunswick Canada.

60
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.190
Michael Shannon: Be is me okay so here, I am in Houston.

61
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.920
Michael Shannon: In a remote office.

62
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.410
Michael Shannon: And then D will say is Boston.

63
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.920
Michael Shannon: nashua.

64
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:35.490
Michael Shannon: Boston Massachusetts nashua new Hampshire kind of like sister cities.

65
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:53.130
Michael Shannon: So if I want to you know my boss, and maybe we're structured this way a kind of a functional organization we're not really project ties we have a pretty strict hierarchy and my immediate boss is in Frederick.

66
00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:12.360
Michael Shannon: And so I communicate information flow and I would you would probably add another arrow here, you know we have a bi directional information flow between me and frederickson we're not only my bosses, but you know editors project managers and so on and so forth.

67
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.600
Michael Shannon: In fact I don't know anybody at Boston.

68
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:26.790
Michael Shannon: There may be somebody there that I have met, but I don't interface so there's no information flow between me and Boston there's no information flow between me and Ireland.

69
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:40.050
Michael Shannon: Where let's say the headquarters are, I have to go through, I have to go it's transitive through see to the main office or through see to nashua.

70
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:48.390
Michael Shannon: Where my HR department is so the mandatory access control model is also you know.

71
00:11:49.770 --> 00:12:03.060
Michael Shannon: going to implement flow rules often like an access control list approach state machine flow rules mandatory now, we talked earlier, you know the CIA triad.

72
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:20.130
Michael Shannon: The Ai is integrity and you know, fundamentally, we get that integrity usually with an H MAC a hashed message authentication code and H map right cryptographic hash with a shared secret key.

73
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.180
Michael Shannon: But that that level of integrity is not enough in a mandatory control environment.

74
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:35.580
Michael Shannon: So Clark Wilson came after bieber or Bebo and it was it was kind of like if we look at vast.

75
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:58.410
Michael Shannon: Vast was meant to you know fix some of the weaknesses are our fill in some of the gaps are some of the earlier types of methodologies like stride and dread that was that was the the goal of Clark Wilson that's all you really need to know but Clark Wilson has higher integrity goals.

76
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:10.980
Michael Shannon: Number one preventing unauthorized users for making modifications, obviously, but secondly, ensuring a separation or segregation of duties.

77
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:30.420
Michael Shannon: In principle, or initiative, where you're preventing authorized users who may still have the capability, but prevent them from making improper changes or modifications and again that is going to involve a mandatory integrity model.

78
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:42.060
Michael Shannon: Well, formed transitions consistency and it uses things like integrity verification procedures integrity rules.

79
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.280
Michael Shannon: Those mechanisms.

80
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.050
Michael Shannon: So that's mandatory access control, a lot of us are used to a role based access control model.

81
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.890
Michael Shannon: This has been widely used, for example in database administration right you'd have.

82
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:12.210
Michael Shannon: You know you have a directory service or something like that, but you'd also have the database administrators and you would have kind of a separate role based access control on the database or tables or views or whatever.

83
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:22.710
Michael Shannon: We also see a role based access control if you're going to do, identity and access management at let's say Amazon web services or Google.

84
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:41.970
Michael Shannon: Where you're going to use their iam service and you're going to set up groups and those groups are usually you know set up around roles in an account, are you a developer, are you part of the testing team, are you the production team.

85
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:53.250
Michael Shannon: Things like that, or you might see a role based access control in certain types of facilities like let's say a clinic a health care clinic a medical clinic.

86
00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:16.320
Michael Shannon: Where you're going to grant permissions and rights based on your role the highest role might be the the md a medical clinic has to have at least one medical doctor on staff at all times at least one that'd be the highest privilege role, but you also have registered nurses.

87
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.250
Michael Shannon: technicians and those you know.

88
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.710
Michael Shannon: The people that do data processing.

89
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.820
Michael Shannon: So those types of roles might be what you're implementing.

90
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:41.100
Michael Shannon: that's going to be determined often it's built into some system but it's often determined by some type of administrator.

91
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.070
Michael Shannon: And I mentioned, you know, a medical Center.

92
00:15:46.500 --> 00:16:04.440
Michael Shannon: If you have a lot of turnover lot of transients people through a call Center temporary employees contractors, you may opt for the role based approach as opposed, as opposed to a discretionary model if there's a lot of turnover let's say in a call Center.

93
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:14.430
Michael Shannon: easy to implement role based mandatory is not easy to implement so on the exam we want to remember that.

94
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:26.730
Michael Shannon: that's going to be the most difficult stringent to implement role based easy often built into the relational database management system, for example.

95
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:48.360
Michael Shannon: It can align easier to your departments your business units your roles and responsibilities, your job titles, but you can have privileges scope creep over time, you also have to be you know, on top of the movement of subjects.

96
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:58.140
Michael Shannon: As they you know work inner disciplinary or inter departmental or they move from one business unit to another.

97
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:12.480
Michael Shannon: Rule based access control usually involve some type of access control list traditionally like if you have an access control list on a router interface.

98
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:33.150
Michael Shannon: or a firewall interface you're basically setting up a set of rules and you're saying what services and ports are we going to allow to and from an IP version for address or an IP version six address so access control rules.

99
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:42.630
Michael Shannon: Or maybe it's a network ankle at aws which applies to all of your instances in a subnet.

100
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.990
Michael Shannon: yeah have it up a set of numbered rules.

101
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.130
Michael Shannon: And the rule based model.

102
00:17:51.390 --> 00:18:05.880
Michael Shannon: is usually going to be something we would call static or stateless where you're analyzing a frame and you're looking at the frame metadata like a transparent firewall.

103
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:18.090
Michael Shannon: A transparent firewall can be deployed as a layer to firewall so it's basically the only IP address it has is the one you're using to manage it.

104
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:27.690
Michael Shannon: it's like a bump into wire and you can deploy routers this way you can deploy their firewalls and firewall appliances this way.

105
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:40.200
Michael Shannon: The advantage of that is you don't have to re address you just in it, you just introduce the firewall and it's looking at frame, so it can look at the ether type field.

106
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:49.860
Michael Shannon: And it can have rules, so you can have permitted deny rules on values in the ether type field of the frame.

107
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.140
Michael Shannon: Like you know layer to keep alive protocols like.

108
00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:07.170
Michael Shannon: discovery protocols that are used by devices like Cisco has a discovery protocol Open Source discovery protocols, where the information is in the frame.

109
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:25.260
Michael Shannon: Be PD use the bridge protocol data units that spanning tree uses that's in the frame so that that would be an example of a rule based access control or at layer three.

110
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:34.020
Michael Shannon: like an infrastructure apple and usually in the layer three apple they have numbers and you start with the lower number.

111
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:46.110
Michael Shannon: And you keep you know processing the rules until there's a match, and as soon as there's a match you take the action and then you move on to the next day to grammar packet.

112
00:19:46.680 --> 00:20:03.150
Michael Shannon: So we call him stateless because they're really agnostic they don't they don't care if it's part of a tcp handshake or a response to a DNS query or an icmp ECHO reply I don't know I don't care.

113
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:14.640
Michael Shannon: i'm just looking at the headers i've got some rules and as soon as there's a match that the action i'm taking and i'm moving on to the next packet or the next frame.

114
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:24.300
Michael Shannon: And they usually have an implicit or an implied denies statement at the end, so that if nothing matches we're going to drop it.

115
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.120
Michael Shannon: Rule based.

116
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:44.370
Michael Shannon: Now it is possible with a rule based type firewall to do other things like, for example, you can have a time based apples that can make permitted denied decisions based on you know the clock.

117
00:20:46.830 --> 00:21:00.150
Michael Shannon: Preferably an NTP server, but these firewalls can also be set up as a stateless access control list, and it can communicate back with some centralized.

118
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:06.330
Michael Shannon: authentication authorization service which we're going to talk about in a few minutes.

119
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.450
Michael Shannon: This isn't, this is just a screenshot of a network apple.

120
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:33.990
Michael Shannon: At Amazon web services, and you can see we're matching on different protocols in their port numbers and port ranges possibly and the source IP version for or IP version six address and or and you're making a decision to allow her to not.

121
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:52.620
Michael Shannon: Rule based and so mandatory access control, again I probably should have had this slide up there with berba and everything else, but very strict very strict need to know very strict least privilege mentality.

122
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.300
Michael Shannon: discretionary is one that a lot of us are.

123
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:13.980
Michael Shannon: Probably maybe more familiar with, especially if you're working let's say in a environment that uses active directory or open l dap or something like that, where you're in an environment where you have the ability to create.

124
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.490
Michael Shannon: Things create files, I can create folders in directories, not just locally, but perhaps on servers.

125
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.720
Michael Shannon: on file servers, for example, or in sharepoint.

126
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:36.240
Michael Shannon: And I create them and i'm the owner, and I can add my discretion share them even grant permissions.

127
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.290
Michael Shannon: it's it's built into the model now some.

128
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.180
Michael Shannon: Groups, you may not grant those permissions and rights.

129
00:22:47.070 --> 00:23:02.310
Michael Shannon: But it's built into the model that certain users in certain groups can have that discretion so much more flexible model it's a much more popular model, especially in commercial directory access.

130
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:12.780
Michael Shannon: or commercial identity providers easy to implement often just integrated and built in to the network operating system.

131
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:23.670
Michael Shannon: You can align it with the least privilege security principle, but it needs massive visibility and it needs to be well designed.

132
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:36.330
Michael Shannon: There is probably the most propensity for privilege or scope creep would be in a discretionary model, just because of the power that.

133
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.320
Michael Shannon: individual users have in creating.

134
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.190
Michael Shannon: objects and granting permissions.

135
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:58.170
Michael Shannon: On there in the rule based that we just looked at, we noticed that we're really focusing on that subjects IP address.

136
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:05.310
Michael Shannon: And that subjects ability to use certain network services and ports.

137
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:14.340
Michael Shannon: At the discretionary model we're really focused on you know what can they do in the directory service really what group are they a member of.

138
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.750
Michael Shannon: is really what dictates their capabilities.

139
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:25.860
Michael Shannon: But it's only a universal kind of forest mentality.

140
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:35.220
Michael Shannon: Zero trust environments are really going to focus on using more modern.

141
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:55.200
Michael Shannon: And I say that, relatively speaking, these aren't brand new but attribute based access, controls that are controlling and authenticating and authorizing the subjects on a session by session basis, not a persistent membership of a group.

142
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.890
Michael Shannon: or a persistent static.

143
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:11.190
Michael Shannon: Access list but based on attributes and characteristics what device, am I using what type of device.

144
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:29.640
Michael Shannon: What channel what what modality, is it wired is it wireless Am I remote, am I, on a vpn am on a software defined network controller, what is the where Am I located geographically what object, am I access to.

145
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.820
Michael Shannon: Multiple environmental factors.

146
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.760
Michael Shannon: Now you can still enforce.

147
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:44.010
Michael Shannon: discretionary mandatory models, with an attribute based system but it's a very elaborate.

148
00:25:44.520 --> 00:26:01.560
Michael Shannon: deployment of an engine and identity engine that also needs to be tied to inventory of your objects and the different States that can change the object the variables of the subject and the multiple variables of the object objects.

149
00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:17.760
Michael Shannon: So, like a Cisco identity services engine or there's quite a few solutions that are out there, often the a back system is going to work hand in hand with 802 dot one X teaneck.

150
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.750
Michael Shannon: Systems okay.

151
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:45.510
Michael Shannon: Often part of our authentication and authorization is going to be relying upon some type of triple A service we don't really use the word AAA that much anymore.

152
00:26:45.930 --> 00:27:07.170
Michael Shannon: it's really identity and access management or identity management or next gen identity things like that, but radius has been around you know, for a long time we call it an IE ETF based solution the the Internet engineering Task Force.

153
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:26.520
Michael Shannon: Do you have to know what that acronym stands for no but I remembered it I etfs so I ETF based means you know it was something that came from the task force is going to have a port number one of those you know one or multiple.

154
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:35.370
Michael Shannon: Set aside ports, you know less than I don't know 1500 or lower maybe.

155
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.070
Michael Shannon: we'll maybe beyond that now.

156
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:54.060
Michael Shannon: And so radius has been around a long time, and we still use it and there's many different variants and flavors of this service, and we know that it's been around a long time just by the name.

157
00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:14.460
Michael Shannon: So radius goes back to you know we were using dial in or dial up services and, like the slip protocol, and maybe you had a modem 56 K modem or maybe an is dn be channel or something like that right well you actually dialed up to a server.

158
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:25.260
Michael Shannon: You have to be aware of the ports, because it doesn't always use a certain set of ports but radius is a AAA service right authentication.

159
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:37.860
Michael Shannon: Who are you are what are you authorization once you are authenticated what are you authorized to do and remember authorization, technically speaking, is optional.

160
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.960
Michael Shannon: I mean, I mean you could you could have a directory service.

161
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:52.260
Michael Shannon: For a startup company and you're a bunch of engineers or a bunch of programmers and you're all you know domain administrators.

162
00:28:53.370 --> 00:29:03.360
Michael Shannon: So I guess there's some authorization there, but we generally want to authorize based on different levels and criteria and different access models.

163
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.030
Michael Shannon: And then, accounting and radius is well known for its accounting.

164
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.770
Michael Shannon: Okay, well known for its accounting now when I say accounting.

165
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:29.730
Michael Shannon: Remember there's two aspects to accounting one is auditing and visibility, I want to know when you started using the service, I want to know when you stop using the service or did this action and then how long did you do it.

166
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:44.220
Michael Shannon: I want visibility, I want to audit you, I want to audit my privilege to users, especially, and then the other aspect of accounting is billing or chargeback I want to know when you started using this.

167
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:49.020
Michael Shannon: Something in our private cloud, and when you stopped.

168
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:58.800
Michael Shannon: This lab environment or this sandbox environment or a private cloud this development, environment, because i'm going to charge it back to you against your budget.

169
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:08.040
Michael Shannon: charge backers show back billing some of us are old enough to remember you know, in the early days of the World Wide Web.

170
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:24.120
Michael Shannon: When you would go and want to get on the Internet or the Web at an airport or a coffee shop or Internet CAFE or whatever you are actually build for the amount of time, you were on the Internet, and they were using radius.

171
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.220
Michael Shannon: Most likely.

172
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.180
Michael Shannon: Now, another thing about AAA services and identity authentication I want to mention to you.

173
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.140
Michael Shannon: there's really kind of two modes.

174
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:43.710
Michael Shannon: that we need to be aware of one of the modes let's say we've got this remote user.

175
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:57.300
Michael Shannon: One of the modes is will be called character mode, in other words, this user regardless whether using a console or some xml rendered whatever.

176
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:13.740
Michael Shannon: they're doing what's called character mode or administrative mode they're connecting to this network access device this perimeter router this wireless access point multi layer switch firewall appliance I don't know.

177
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:20.730
Michael Shannon: But they're connecting to it and they're being authenticated an authorized by some back end.

178
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:41.940
Michael Shannon: centralized authentication services or cluster or elaborate back end whatever maybe active directory on the back end, but the point is its character motor administrative mode this person is connecting because they want to administer they want to configure this device.

179
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:57.840
Michael Shannon: They want to administer commands to this device character mode so they're being authenticated authorized and accounted for for that activity that mode now can you.

180
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:10.770
Michael Shannon: have this device itself provide the authentication authorization services yeah usually not accounting, but you can have a local authentication authorization.

181
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:26.790
Michael Shannon: Even though that's doable maybe in a small business or a small office Home Office or a lab that's not really what we would do in the real world, we would definitely rely upon some centralized.

182
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:38.880
Michael Shannon: authentication service identity management service so that's the first mode, the second most will be called packet or network mode.

183
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:54.930
Michael Shannon: Because I want to go through this network access device will call it or access proxy to some server so a web server in the dmz or ftp server so it's network modes packet mode.

184
00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:03.210
Michael Shannon: i'm being authenticated an authorized and accounted for because i'm sending data grams through this device to some servers service.

185
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:17.460
Michael Shannon: So there's kind of two modes need to be aware of your like, why is that important well when you deploy like an identity management service often they have like default authorization profiles.

186
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:39.090
Michael Shannon: For example, like a Cisco identity service engine is by default going to say okay i'm a Cisco IMC and I usually am deployed in a Cisco environment, so if you're going to access this device, and you want to administer it i'm going to by default i'm going to use the attack X plus protocol.

187
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:53.220
Michael Shannon: tak X plus now, if you want to do network or packet mode my off profile is going to use radius or diameter diameter is the next generation of radius.

188
00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.930
Michael Shannon: Now something else about this authentication proxy.

189
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:16.380
Michael Shannon: And this is what we call you know mediated access something else, but this authentication proxy is they, it can be interactive or transparent, so I can present some type of prompt or some captive portal to this remote user.

190
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:28.320
Michael Shannon: Or the remote user doesn't really know i'm there and I transparently process it and often what i'm doing is i'm rewriting a URL or something and sending it along.

191
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:44.220
Michael Shannon: I mentioned tak X plus developed by Cisco there was a there was a previous Protocol called tak X PAC ACS again don't worry about what it stands for.

192
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:53.790
Michael Shannon: This is really one of those protocols that we're really glad that we just use the acronym there was a tax before that it's not backward compatible.

193
00:34:54.690 --> 00:35:07.620
Michael Shannon: Okay, and it's commonly used, especially in homogenous Cisco environments, even though you can find Open Source Linux tak X servers and radius servers of course okay.

194
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:13.440
Michael Shannon: That there are differences between tak X and radius taxes tcp based.

195
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:19.950
Michael Shannon: So there's a three way handshake and a connection setup whereas radius uses UDP.

196
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.660
Michael Shannon: With radius when the.

197
00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:36.870
Michael Shannon: When the network access device whatever it is, was a wireless access point communicates back with the radius server.

198
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:45.630
Michael Shannon: The radius server is going to send one unified message saying yes you're authenticated or you pass.

199
00:35:46.290 --> 00:36:01.080
Michael Shannon: You pass the authentication and in the same communication here's what you're authorized to do and i'm optionally going to account for you, with attack X plus you can separate that it's it's it's two separate.

200
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:12.840
Michael Shannon: communications, in fact, you could have a TAC X authentication service and a different authorization service to separate communications.

201
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:20.940
Michael Shannon: it's also more secure, because everything the entire communication is encrypted so there's differences now.

202
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:39.390
Michael Shannon: One of the things about diameter, if you ask well why did they you know why did they update it, why did they created diameter protocol, a lot of diameter is basically to do some of the things that tech X plus does but diameter was also designed.

203
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:54.030
Michael Shannon: along the lines of thinking about other ways to authenticate and authorize besides, just like password credentials, so it was kind of forward thinking you know with things like biometrics in mind.

204
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.050
Michael Shannon: So there are differences okay.

205
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:25.980
Michael Shannon: If it's a Cisco router it can leverage what you set up on the device these per command authorization and privilege levels devices have 16 privilege levels zero through 15 and so with tak X plus if you've already set these up on the device tak X plus can leverage that.

206
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.530
Michael Shannon: that's why it's very popular with Cisco environments.

207
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:50.040
Michael Shannon: let's talk about saml because we were I was, I was talking about the IE tf based protocols so we're talking about the 80s and 90s right, so you know elder care of Ross I guess you wouldn't really put in that category, but curb Ross does use port numbers.

208
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:59.640
Michael Shannon: So we had we had you know, a tech X tech has plus radius they were I ETF base port numbers and they were very popular.

209
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:17.760
Michael Shannon: And they were used in enterprises and organizations all over the world, and then in the 90s, you know we got that web browser thing and then we had http, which was a transport mechanism right to transport hypertext markup language.

210
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.970
Michael Shannon: Documents http so a lot of people started thinking well.

211
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:38.430
Michael Shannon: Why can't we use http as a transport mechanism for authentication and authorization information, especially when we want to get those kind of services on the Internet.

212
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:45.990
Michael Shannon: And they didn't they didn't use care for us on the Internet because Kevin Ross didn't support forward secrecy and other issues.

213
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:59.280
Michael Shannon: But people were like yeah that's a good idea, because this this worldwide web thing is really doing exploding so we're thinking, the visit the.com boom, so a lot of people started coming up with solutions.

214
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:11.550
Michael Shannon: And the kind of the cream that rose to the top was saml security assertion markup language and in the name says it, it provides security.

215
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.270
Michael Shannon: Big black because it's going to offer some assertion.

216
00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:26.370
Michael Shannon: Right a token and it's it's xml based markup language so saml 1.1 was the one that really stuck.

217
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:41.730
Michael Shannon: Around the turn of the century feels weird to say that around the turn of the century that one stuck and you know it involves identity provider some type of source of information about the subject.

218
00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:46.170
Michael Shannon: A directory service some other database.

219
00:39:47.190 --> 00:40:02.010
Michael Shannon: And then, a service provider, something that provides services and again there's a federated trust between the identity provider and the service provider and, by the way, setting up that relationship, especially early on wasn't that easy.

220
00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.840
Michael Shannon: It was it was an acquired skill.

221
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:13.410
Michael Shannon: involved sharing things and creating tokens and trust tokens and things like that.

222
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:21.660
Michael Shannon: Then of course there's the consumer the consumer of the service.

223
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:26.070
Michael Shannon: Who is relying upon the identity provider.

224
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:38.970
Michael Shannon: And the trust relationship to give them a token, which is a temporary time based maybe a json chunk of code or something a ticket.

225
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:56.250
Michael Shannon: But i'm going to present to the service provider now remember the identity provider let's say it's directory active directory or open elder APP or something like that maybe back then maybe it was Novell you know the directory service has a lot of information about that employee.

226
00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:07.350
Michael Shannon: But in the assertion i'm not going to tell the service provider everything I have in my directory the service provider only needs a certain amount of information.

227
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:16.890
Michael Shannon: We have a trust relationship, I need a certain amount of information, so that I can trust that assertion about that user that consumer.

228
00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:29.610
Michael Shannon: And there's a diagram put in here to kind of help you with Amazon web services understanding what's going on under the hood is not the important thing it's very.

229
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:52.860
Michael Shannon: Very common to use saml, and this is a single sign on capability, I can sign on once to my identity provider with identity store and then for the lifetime of that session I can access all of these services and service providers that have an established trust.

230
00:41:54.090 --> 00:42:02.130
Michael Shannon: With my identity provider and I present a time based token an assertion now.

231
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:26.760
Michael Shannon: what's interesting is saml two point O was kind of the de facto standard in the mid 2000s I don't know what we call that the odds back in the odds, the 2000s that the first you know decade around the middle saml two point O is the de facto standard.

232
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:39.060
Michael Shannon: Universities organizations, it was hot and it made sense, because we could use http and https as our transport mechanism.

233
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:51.270
Michael Shannon: And it was kind of built the way the World Wide Web was traditionally built, you know xml based use protocols like soap.

234
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.980
Michael Shannon: Then the iPhone came out.

235
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:14.730
Michael Shannon: And that was an immediate game changer began it because the iPhone and the developers of the of the Apps there was some level of secrecy to that and it kind of, as we know, it was a game changer and the people that develop those mobile Apps.

236
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:28.650
Michael Shannon: Because these were different types of devices, they really didn't want to develop Apps based on the website model, the soap based xml model.

237
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:41.490
Michael Shannon: So the people that had developed saml two point O data decision to make do we rewrite saml 2.0 to make it saml three.

238
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:59.100
Michael Shannon: To make it align with these new developers and what they want to use like api's restful APIs and json and things like that, and make it backward compatible, we want to do that the answer was no.

239
00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:12.090
Michael Shannon: No, I mean it's like they had just gotten, to the point where they were getting that kind of saturation and then here comes the iPhone Okay, so those folks.

240
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:25.860
Michael Shannon: went a different route or different route they went with oh off the open authorization framework now when I say oh what it is, you know authorization.

241
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.570
Michael Shannon: Okay.

242
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:30.180
Michael Shannon: and

243
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:57.240
Michael Shannon: To implement oauth properly, you should implement oh off with a identity layer or an authentication layer So if you just deploy co op and it does your authentication we call that pseudo authentication because really oh off was designed to work with oh IDC open ID connect.

244
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:21.210
Michael Shannon: The identity layer on top of oauth verifying the end user, using some type of service or server identity provider, but remember it's rest restful APIs and supporting web based mobile javascript you know the things that were on the iPhone and other mobile devices, so there was this divergence.

245
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:31.770
Michael Shannon: You know this this major divergence and but saml kept on going, and we still use it and there's other things like saml that we use.

246
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.270
Michael Shannon: Okay.

247
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:40.350
Michael Shannon: I put a slide in here for the process again not important for the exam.

248
00:45:46.650 --> 00:46:04.620
Michael Shannon: shibboleth is like saml 2.0 and it's it's popular because it's open source and free so like a lot of colleges and universities and nonprofits used shibboleth, but it still involves the same things Okay, the identity provider.

249
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.390
Michael Shannon: The service or service provider than the consumer.

250
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.210
Michael Shannon: The one that gets the assertion.

251
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:31.650
Michael Shannon: Now those same concepts, we find in Cuba Ross we often we often think you know Microsoft active directory kubler Ross they go hand in hand and they do, but kubler Ross was it was invented by MIT and it existed.

252
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:36.900
Michael Shannon: before it was implemented into windows servers.

253
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.930
Michael Shannon: windows had their own methodology.

254
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:41.850
Michael Shannon: Back in the day.

255
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:44.940
Michael Shannon: And you know.

256
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:57.330
Michael Shannon: But today it's curb Ross now there's a lot of it's a single sign on system and often we have Kevin Ross we're being we're using that in our enterprise.

257
00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:13.860
Michael Shannon: On a local area network and then we're also using a saml two point O federation with Google or my aws or work day or salesforce or many of the other SAS providers.

258
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:22.500
Michael Shannon: it's a single sign on it's a secret key crypto system it's assertion is a ticket.

259
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:36.690
Michael Shannon: It does mutual authentication of the care burglarized subject and the server and servers services, it depends on you know if you break down Kevin Ross.

260
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:56.190
Michael Shannon: it's kind of like how I mentioned tak X plus can be kind of broken down Kevin Ross has a key distribution Center which can technically have two different services, the authentication server is the one that's going to grant the initial ticket to the user.

261
00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:09.120
Michael Shannon: And you know, an active directory the device and the user are in the directory service so it's a curb arise device.

262
00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:18.360
Michael Shannon: So once per they login and they're going to get a ticket or they're going to be authenticated and authorized from the authentication server.

263
00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:36.510
Michael Shannon: Then, as they go in, they access, you know, exchange and a file server and sharepoint and that kind of stuff I get a ticket granting server ticket that's based on the service once per service session.

264
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:38.310
Michael Shannon: OK.

265
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:50.310
Michael Shannon: Now the, the main thing that we want to take away from this today is that most cloud providers really want us to use single sign on.

266
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:56.370
Michael Shannon: If you go to Amazon web services you go to Google cloud platform, especially azure.

267
00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:18.270
Michael Shannon: They would really prefer that you don't use them as the identity provider, they give you they have an iam service absolutely Google and aws both have the ability to go and create groups and users but you're really setting up a separate siloed.

268
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:29.040
Michael Shannon: Identity provider with them that is separate from what your users are using on site or remote offices or whatever.

269
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:37.650
Michael Shannon: And that was kind of the way it was done, but today i'd say, starting at around you know 2020 the last couple of years.

270
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:39.780
Michael Shannon: They really.

271
00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:47.400
Michael Shannon: tried to gravitate you towards using a managed to single sign on service that they have.

272
00:49:50.190 --> 00:50:04.440
Michael Shannon: And so, if you're using active directory and kubler Ross, for example, aws you have options like you can use an active directory connector to connect to aws to their aws single sign on service and they'll you have a portal.

273
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:13.290
Michael Shannon: Right, you have the user has a portal it comes up it's a you know, an aws graphical xml rendered thing.

274
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:19.950
Michael Shannon: And it has you know links in it, these are the accounts, I want to access, but it will also they have a ton.

275
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:44.370
Michael Shannon: Of pre cooked federated relationships with many software as a service providers, so you can have icons for office 365 and dropbox and the list goes on and on it's a managed service that from a security management standpoint is kind of the way things are moving they prefer you.

276
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:58.680
Michael Shannon: And, and what some startup companies will do is they won't even have a local directory service there'll be a startup company and they'll run a virtual active directory instance.

277
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:10.620
Michael Shannon: At an azure, for example, so i'm a startup company I don't even have directory servers i'm using azure active directory and office 365 it's all in the cloud.

278
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:23.640
Michael Shannon: And the beauty of that is they're going to make it very easy for me to do single sign on with other partners and vendors.

279
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:36.240
Michael Shannon: don't even worry about it they'll take care of all the saml stuff under the hood or the oh oh IDC stuff under the hood if i'm an APP developer so awesome.

280
00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:50.130
Michael Shannon: So you know identity management involves provisioning and D provisioning provisioning and D provisioning subjects.

281
00:51:50.700 --> 00:52:05.550
Michael Shannon: And provisioning and D provisioning the devices that they have access to that they're authorized to use and other services, there are you know third party platforms that can assist us in doing this.

282
00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:16.140
Michael Shannon: Especially with mobile device management their software service providers that can assist us in this life cycle, but remember when you're.

283
00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:28.200
Michael Shannon: When you're provisioning and D provisioning we have what are called joiners we have what are called movers and we have what are called leavers by those are kind of the three elements we have to be.

284
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:39.600
Michael Shannon: concerned about and the joiners and the leavers is kind of obvious the movers maybe more complicated right the ones that are being promoted the ones that are going.

285
00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:50.070
Michael Shannon: to another division in our large multinational corporation a different geographic area Okay, we have to accommodate for those movers.

286
00:52:51.030 --> 00:53:06.750
Michael Shannon: and identity management will also one of the driving factors behind not only our access control model which by the way, in a large enough organization, you may be using different access control models.

287
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:21.630
Michael Shannon: For example, you might have for your employees of the corporate land, you may be using a discretionary access control model, but for the people that work in the call Center they're in there in a role based model.

288
00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:28.290
Michael Shannon: Maybe you've got an R amp D department or your developers there an IMAC model so.

289
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:37.380
Michael Shannon: don't think that you can't use multiple models, maybe within an A back environment attribute based engine.

290
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:39.810
Michael Shannon: And an enterprise.

291
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:45.660
Michael Shannon: But the type of organization, you have will also drive these decisions.

292
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:57.600
Michael Shannon: A functional organization tends to harken back to the kind of post.

293
00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:17.730
Michael Shannon: And you know the World War Two days being about the 70s and 80s most a lot of those people that were in management men and women at those at those companies they you know they were veterans or they came from that type of environment, so it was a very top down structure very monolithic.

294
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:26.190
Michael Shannon: Very functional you know very strict departmental vertical.

295
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:37.710
Michael Shannon: Communication chain of command functional departments some organizations still operate that way, the trend, however, in the 90s.

296
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:45.540
Michael Shannon: was to kind of move away from a purely functional organization to either, something that was more project eyes.

297
00:54:46.710 --> 00:55:04.560
Michael Shannon: Okay, so some organizations like began as a flat organization and we think about a lot of the.com companies a lot of the you know social media companies they're more project ties flatter.

298
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:15.630
Michael Shannon: Not necessarily that monolithic chain of command and you have people with different skill sets that are working enter departmental on multiple projects simultaneously.

299
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.520
Michael Shannon: Teams more team based more project based.

300
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:27.990
Michael Shannon: A flatter organization or some combination thereof, like you know.

301
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:40.650
Michael Shannon: Usually, a organization that was that had been around you know, a while, since the 60s or 70s, or longer they wouldn't just move from in the 90s from a functional organization to.

302
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:48.870
Michael Shannon: we're going to go flat they're set up some type of hybrid some type of matrix organization.

303
00:55:49.440 --> 00:56:03.090
Michael Shannon: And there's different types of matrix organizations, this really ties kind of into project manager type stuff those of you who are project managers, this is like oh yeah I know where I know what he's talking about.

304
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:13.530
Michael Shannon: So on the exam the point is our identity management or identity and access management and our access control models.

305
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:20.730
Michael Shannon: are going to be driven and influenced by the way our organization is structured okay.

306
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:27.150
Michael Shannon: Now what however you set up your quote accounts, if you do have accounts.

307
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:37.590
Michael Shannon: it's important that you have massive visibility and reviews and this can be automated in fact.

308
00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:43.380
Michael Shannon: At a cloud provider if you're using let's say the iam.

309
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:53.940
Michael Shannon: service at aws they have what's called an access analyzer so if you're using aws is identity management service.

310
00:56:54.630 --> 00:57:04.620
Michael Shannon: The permissions and usually you're going to you're going to grant that you're going to give the permissions and when I say permissions What I mean is what API calls, can they make.

311
00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:10.110
Michael Shannon: What API request can they make to the cloud services.

312
00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:14.520
Michael Shannon: that's in a json document.

313
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.770
Michael Shannon: that's what the permissions are typically apply to a group.

314
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:32.940
Michael Shannon: Because usually you create groups, they get the permissions or that what API calls Can I make and then you put as you add users, the users get put into the groups.

315
00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:47.880
Michael Shannon: So they haven't they have an access analyzer tool with a with a machine learning engine that will analyze all the json and look for duplicates privilege creep.

316
00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:50.580
Michael Shannon: And we give you reporting.

317
00:57:51.720 --> 00:58:02.880
Michael Shannon: Now, I mentioned the iam service but like I said from a zero trust standpoint, this is not considered an optimal solution.

318
00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:23.490
Michael Shannon: Because if I use their iam service, I can create a group which can make these API calls and I put users in that group that has a persistent ongoing capability to make API calls to services 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

319
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:28.530
Michael Shannon: Now, can I place conditions.

320
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:41.400
Michael Shannon: In the permissions yeah I can but it's very complicated and the more conditions I have, the more things you were to come up in an analyzer.

321
00:58:44.850 --> 00:59:00.060
Michael Shannon: So it kind of violates the zero trust initiative, which would like to authenticate and authorize the subject on a session by session basis, which is what you would use if you were doing single sign on.

322
00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:05.760
Michael Shannon: you're getting a temporary token that's time based.

323
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:19.500
Michael Shannon: And it's just for that session and in a zero trust environment we prefer that, as opposed to a persistent consistent capability.

324
00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.370
Michael Shannon: And that's why I said, you know.

325
00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:41.700
Michael Shannon: The cloud providers, they really are kind of moving you away from their iam services, which is that persistence type of thing to a single sign on now, obviously with single sign on, there are some pros and cons.

326
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:47.310
Michael Shannon: And i've got a slide here, this is slide number 10 i'm going back.

327
00:59:48.390 --> 01:00:01.320
Michael Shannon: With single sign on you have a single point of failure, so the from it from an exam standpoint from a security manager standpoint if we're using single sign on that initial.

328
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:12.840
Michael Shannon: credential is a key to your kingdom so in a single sign on environment at the very least, we want to have multi factor authentication.

329
01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:17.310
Michael Shannon: preferably a biometric.

330
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:24.510
Michael Shannon: That is a more accurate identification method as opposed to something you have right.

331
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:32.040
Michael Shannon: something you have can eat can be stolen or borrowed or shared or whatever.

332
01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.910
Michael Shannon: something you are no.

333
01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.800
Michael Shannon: And this is not, you know it's something you are biometrics, this is not like that movie minority report.

334
01:00:47.580 --> 01:01:02.520
Michael Shannon: Where Tom cruise replaced his eyeballs and had his old eyeball in a refrigerator and went back to the secure headquarters and put his old eyeball up to the sensor and got into the building.

335
01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:05.970
Michael Shannon: laughable.

336
01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:08.430
Michael Shannon: So.

337
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:16.170
Michael Shannon: That single point of failure really demands stringent multi factor authentication.

338
01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:33.000
Michael Shannon: And not just a simple two factor, something you know something you have there's also other types of special of attacks replay attacks sessions can be hijacked if this is not done over a secure channel.

339
01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:38.250
Michael Shannon: Right to mls 1.2 or higher.

340
01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.450
Michael Shannon: Or if it's over IP SEC.

341
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:47.910
Michael Shannon: You know if you're just using vpn technology.

342
01:01:51.210 --> 01:02:01.350
Michael Shannon: you're still vulnerable vulnerable with with single sign on environments, which is why companies like Google don't use vpn clients anymore.

343
01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:08.040
Michael Shannon: running a vpn client on an endpoint is a.

344
01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:13.350
Michael Shannon: false sense of security, let me just put it that way.

345
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:26.430
Michael Shannon: Okay, you can say i'm not worried about my subjects my people because I they're using vpn clients on their remote devices.

346
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:30.240
Michael Shannon: Good luck with that.

347
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.300
Michael Shannon: So.

348
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:57.540
Michael Shannon: auditing of the accounts, the more and then we're automating this process and centralized it can be the better right security officers typically let's as a small business or a small organization aren't going to go through a manual account audit but.

349
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:09.570
Michael Shannon: You know i've done that in the past as as as a security consultant, and what am I looking for well i'm looking for shared administrator passwords.

350
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:23.190
Michael Shannon: Right people that are logging on as an administrator to a directory to a system or to a local device and they're just sharing the admin password i'm looking for other guest accounts.

351
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:32.610
Michael Shannon: Have applications and services, been installed into a service account with a weak password that maybe that shared.

352
01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:34.590
Michael Shannon: Okay.

353
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:39.960
Michael Shannon: The lack of you know guidance and best practices.

354
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:52.380
Michael Shannon: So to implement identity management there's the initial configuration phase which we would call provisioning right onboarding.

355
01:03:53.130 --> 01:04:15.540
Michael Shannon: Providing credentials determining what are they authorized to do, based on our models and then the operational phase where you know you're presenting the badge you're scanning it you're providing the token you're using the biometric sensor whatever it is OK so identity management.

356
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:22.680
Michael Shannon: Usually is relying upon some type of access or identity service engine.

357
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.950
Michael Shannon: And it's going to be an attribute based access control model.

358
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:47.790
Michael Shannon: Because you need to have different authorization profiles, depending upon you know who, what, when, where is it wired wireless are you in a vpn are you in a software defined network controller, are you using single sign on to federated partners.

359
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:55.110
Michael Shannon: And then you know here's a nice little table of use cases.

360
01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:06.300
Michael Shannon: For why we need identity management this this is helpful from a security management standpoint, you have to secure that guest V land.

361
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:17.490
Michael Shannon: You want visibility and how the assets are being accessed byob policies or other types of mobile policies.

362
01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:32.850
Michael Shannon: threat containment compliance The list goes on, so like I mentioned Google really relies heavily on 802 dot one X teaneck and.

363
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:34.650
Michael Shannon: Max SEC.

364
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:50.310
Michael Shannon: But never get mission control technically the exam still once you to know that term, even though it's not really used anymore knack was a Cisco.

365
01:05:51.870 --> 01:06:07.800
Michael Shannon: invention, I mean Cisco, then the acronym came from Cisco now other organizations and other platforms would do similar things, but they were they call them something else, like a Microsoft called there's na P, or something.

366
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:22.920
Michael Shannon: But the bottom line of using never admission control with dot one X is the ability to have flexibility and now you can handle that supplicant so let me give you an example.

367
01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:28.200
Michael Shannon: let's say Dave and I are going to go to a summit.

368
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.900
Michael Shannon: So we're going to go to the corporate headquarters we're going to have a get together.

369
01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.300
Michael Shannon: Hopefully, hopefully we'll get to have one of those soon, so I haven't seen Dave and.

370
01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.210
Michael Shannon: I don't know, three years.

371
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:59.430
Michael Shannon: So you know Dave goes to Boston right and he takes his corporate provisioned Dell laptop right, the one that they you know they gave him or I go there and the one I got through fedex.

372
01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:22.170
Michael Shannon: Dave also takes an iPhone or a pad and then Dave also has a personal laptop because we're going to be there for three days and Dave wants to you know he wants to do cyber currency trading or play online poker or whatever he wants to do he's not going to do it on the corporate laptop.

373
01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:40.980
Michael Shannon: So he has another separate laptop so he brings three devices so Dave shows up, and you know hey everybody high five hugs good to see you Dave go grab a empty desk empty cubicle or go find a conference room right and Dave does.

374
01:07:42.030 --> 01:08:03.660
Michael Shannon: So if Dave has his corporate provision laptop let's say for performance reasons he wants to put it on the ethernet right, so he finds a cubicle or a desk and he plugs in and what's going to happen in a dot one X environment well the switch that he's connecting to.

375
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.490
Michael Shannon: And usually over some type of you know frames.

376
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.310
Michael Shannon: Of the cable runs.

377
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:19.440
Michael Shannon: it's a dot one X enabled switch multi layer switch layer to switch whatever this device.

378
01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:35.340
Michael Shannon: will call it, it is going to expect his device which is a supplicant and we call it a supplicant because it's begging to get on the network that's what dot one X calls it it's not a client.

379
01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:50.250
Michael Shannon: In a dot one X architecture, the client is this network access device the dot one X enabled multi layer switch or the wireless access point that's the client to radius.

380
01:08:51.450 --> 01:09:01.230
Michael Shannon: and other services that's the client in dot one X, this is a supplicant now when Dave connects to the ethernet ports.

381
01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:22.800
Michael Shannon: He has a supplicant he has the Cisco any connect mobility client, which is also a dot one X applicant so it's going to send a P O l eXtensible authentication protocol overland a P O l frames, to the switch or the wireless access point if he decides to do wireless.

382
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:42.450
Michael Shannon: Now, if the device doesn't hear from Dave it'll say it'll send AAP request ID frames hey wake up dude I need your credentials now Dave is going to give his active directory login.

383
01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:54.660
Michael Shannon: And this device is going to pass those back using the radius protocol and to it back end open l dap or active directory.

384
01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.400
Michael Shannon: And then he's going to get on to the to the network okay.

385
01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:07.530
Michael Shannon: that's the way it should work easy peasy smooth because he's using his provisioned laptop.

386
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:18.030
Michael Shannon: it's on the direct active directory he's on the directory he's got the mobility supplicant AAP client on there.

387
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:20.640
Michael Shannon: But.

388
01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.320
Michael Shannon: What if Dave takes his other laptop.

389
01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:37.290
Michael Shannon: And he connects it to the switch let's say either say he doesn't have a supplicant on there, no, no, you got one X applicant.

390
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:58.350
Michael Shannon: the beauty of this dot one X is part of network admission control is I can I can then give him a captive portal and say you need to go and remediate to remediation servers or next servers where you need to go install a agent.

391
01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:13.140
Michael Shannon: A supplicant supplicant oh and, by the way, not just the supplicant but you need to install this anti virus, you need to install the corporate malware Bytes program need to update this or that so.

392
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:22.110
Michael Shannon: This is called change of authorization once he remediate and he puts all that stuff on his personal laptop.

393
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:30.420
Michael Shannon: Then I can say well i'm not going to give you access to the corporate network, because this device is not in the active directory but.

394
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:40.980
Michael Shannon: I will let you go to the wireless access point and go out on the guest V land, so I can put you in a guest feel and or maybe you were in a restricted V land.

395
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:49.320
Michael Shannon: And then you remediated and now i'll see Oh, a change of authorization Now you can be in the guest be land and you can go to the Internet.

396
01:11:49.740 --> 01:12:02.580
Michael Shannon: Subject to URL filtering web content filtering data loss prevention engines and other things okay you're not going to connect and go to the Internet, and you know serve porn.

397
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:13.740
Michael Shannon: or play online poker you want to do that do it in your hotel room and there's, and this applies to a wide variety of different types of devices.

398
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.710
Michael Shannon: And this is a very important aspect of.

399
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:26.370
Michael Shannon: Zero trust, because there is some type of identity service engine.

400
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:34.650
Michael Shannon: With a inventory engine, and this is usually like if it's Google, this is called an access proxy.

401
01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:41.910
Michael Shannon: which may not even be a physical device, it may be running in a hypervisor to access proxy.

402
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.740
Michael Shannon: Okay.

403
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.730
Michael Shannon: So multi factor authentication critical.

404
01:12:52.050 --> 01:13:01.920
Michael Shannon: In a single sign on environment in a where you have highly sensitive assets, intellectual property and, by the way, if you're.

405
01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:18.540
Michael Shannon: If you are set up with identity access management at like Google or aws they really recommend multifactor authentication even if it's just something like a one to one card for the account.

406
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:24.000
Michael Shannon: on any type of user that can change or modify.

407
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.700
Michael Shannon: Something running in the cloud.

408
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.830
Michael Shannon: So I mentioned remember accounting is the third piece of the.

409
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:36.480
Michael Shannon: A.

410
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.910
Michael Shannon: radius radius and diameter excel at accounting.

411
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:45.870
Michael Shannon: And there's two main reasons for doing it okay.

412
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:48.450
Michael Shannon: don't forget.

413
01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:50.160
Michael Shannon: Part of.

414
01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:54.480
Michael Shannon: Our single sign on and our.

415
01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:59.130
Michael Shannon: Identity management is also some of the call session management.

416
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:19.290
Michael Shannon: And you could consider what Carol Ross does as I access sharepoint and then exchange and then the file servers and then whatever that is Kevin Ross providing session management, because i'm using session tickets it's also the same thing when i'm.

417
01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:32.880
Michael Shannon: Providing a token or to assertion to a service provider another concept, this is the last name we're going to talk about we're going to switch topics here, you know at our break.

418
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:45.240
Michael Shannon: Yes, there's registration provisioning onboarding process there's also proofing so you know proofing involves an additional layer

419
01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:58.620
Michael Shannon: When you are hiring somebody it's one thing to take their information usually through HR which is integrated with a directory service and legal and whatever you're taking all their information they provide you.

420
01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:06.570
Michael Shannon: Either done through a portal, or you know they've their information they've written out on paper and inputting that.

421
01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:26.970
Michael Shannon: But you can't necessarily accept that information at face value, and especially the higher the privilege of that employee there, it may be identity proofing where you have to see two forms of ID right a national identity card a passport a driver license.

422
01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:42.990
Michael Shannon: proofing may also involve digital documentation, because often the person you're hiring they're not even coming into the facility, this has to be done with docusign with a remote employee.

423
01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:49.830
Michael Shannon: That you know you've hired but they're not going to be in the headquarters because of you know coven.

424
01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.770
Michael Shannon: So proofing.

425
01:15:54.420 --> 01:16:06.540
Michael Shannon: is also kind of the next higher layer the registration process and Bridget registration without proofing is a violation of the zero trust initiative.

426
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:09.390
Michael Shannon: Okay.

427
01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:34.530
Michael Shannon: One reason or another, is our proofing let's go back to advanced persistent threats, the more elaborate your proofing and background checks, the better because remember an advanced persistent threat if your assets are valuable enough your competitor some cracker some.

428
01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:41.850
Michael Shannon: Crime syndicate some other state will go to the.

429
01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:52.470
Michael Shannon: elaborate process of creating fake identities and getting someone hired into your organization.

430
01:16:56.310 --> 01:17:07.410
Michael Shannon: And you know that's why proofing is so important because this person may not be who they say they are and they're actually part of it, of a PT campaign.

431
01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:20.700
Michael Shannon: Now what was weird was in the objectives when you look at the objectives of the CIS SP I don't know why, but they mentioned.

432
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:32.430
Michael Shannon: Like you know how about have an objective and they'll put in parentheses something else, well, they did that they put Microsoft forefront identity manager.

433
01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:41.730
Michael Shannon: I don't know why I guess they wanted you to kind of look at that, as a prototypical solution.

434
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:55.140
Michael Shannon: But it's not even called that anymore, so that that's the problem when people put out an exam every three years and make some weird decision to put something vendor specific in there don't know why they did it.

435
01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:01.860
Michael Shannon: So, because the solution is not even called forefront anymore it's Am I am.

436
01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:12.390
Michael Shannon: But what i'll tell you is maybe you might want to go and do a little bit of research on microsoft's identity manager.

437
01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:22.830
Michael Shannon: The hybrid experience means that you could be also a hybrid cloud environment with azure because when you use Microsoft azure.

438
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:31.140
Michael Shannon: Their model there I am model is basically a virtual instance of active directory.

439
01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:43.500
Michael Shannon: If you have an account right now, like a Microsoft account like outlook.com or msn.com some account you already have a virtual.

440
01:18:44.280 --> 01:19:01.620
Michael Shannon: Active directory instance just waiting for you in the azure cloud like once you create that account they create an instance of azure active directory for that account waiting to be initialized Okay, so when we get back from our break.

441
01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:07.830
Michael Shannon: we're going to get into our next topic and we're going to talk about kind of.

442
01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:28.200
Michael Shannon: client server vs distributed and we're going to get deeper into database stuff we we we just kind of danced around some database stuff on Monday, but we're going to go through some data security and we're going to get into hypervisor is in cloud okay.

443
01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.250
Michael Shannon: So that's what we have coming up in our next.

444
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:35.790
Michael Shannon: Section, so let me stop the recording.

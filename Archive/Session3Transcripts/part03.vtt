1
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.890
Michael Shannon: Alright we're recording.

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.340
Michael Shannon: i'm going to repeat that mistake so.

3
00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.310
Michael Shannon: We are recording welcome back from break everybody.

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.260
Michael Shannon: And SCI fi our.

5
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.600
Michael Shannon: Micro services specific service oriented application components.

6
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.030
Michael Shannon: kind of the next generation of what we would call so a years ago.

7
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:46.650
Michael Shannon: And approach to software development, where the results are small, independent services that communicate using api's.

8
00:00:47.550 --> 00:01:05.850
Michael Shannon: queuing services, the do or api's to do queuing and communication channels notifications so kind of decoupling monolithic applications so with microservices you can use a micro service, obviously in different applications.

9
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:25.500
Michael Shannon: Obviously, but it also you know feeds into rapid deployment and rapid scalability tightly coupled tightly scoped little diagram they're tightly scope loosely coupled thoroughly modulator and encapsulated.

10
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.100
Michael Shannon: Independent independently deployable.

11
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:50.580
Michael Shannon: We have a lot of embedded systems that use older APP operating systems specialized APP or systems thin operating systems and often unpatched and older versions of APP of operating systems.

12
00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:04.380
Michael Shannon: Sometimes device drivers are no longer available you bought a specialty embedded system or a programmable logic controller or some sensor from some manufacturer.

13
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:16.080
Michael Shannon: And then that manufacturer was bought out by some other company and that company simply bought them to get rid of a competitor, and you know no longer have tech support.

14
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:30.030
Michael Shannon: You can't replace that, but it still works, so if it ain't broke don't fix it, but you don't have patch management you don't have updates or upgrades or security patches.

15
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.930
Michael Shannon: And there is just hundreds of millions of devices all over the world that are.

16
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:48.240
Michael Shannon: Using IP version for addresses and IP version six with these different types of specialty systems, some of these came from.

17
00:02:48.780 --> 00:03:07.200
Michael Shannon: raspberry pi which was kind of a phenomenon in the UK, and it was a way to teach kids how to do computer programming computer science and then it kind of exploded in popularity one of my favorite shows is a.

18
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.450
Michael Shannon: battle bots.

19
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.450
Michael Shannon: it's it's one of my favorite shows and it's you know where people create robots and they you know destroy each other.

20
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:30.060
Michael Shannon: I find it very fascinating rather watch machines do that, then people do that, personally, but I just love the different designs well, a lot of those.

21
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:45.060
Michael Shannon: robots that they create in the battle bots they use specialty embedded operating systems and maybe maybe raspberry pi or others like arduino system on a chip those different variants.

22
00:03:46.260 --> 00:04:08.250
Michael Shannon: This is pretty practical you know we're talking about Linux based operating system, so you know don't use empty passwords avoid any type of auto configuration unnecessary services secure Shell there's a fail to band tool that detects brute forces attacks and blocks them.

23
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:26.490
Michael Shannon: So raspberry pi system on a chip, you know, regardless of these special components or iot devices or wearables they have a general lack of security, and so this is a area of specialty.

24
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:39.030
Michael Shannon: Just like skate systems fca da which are you know specialty approaches to securing different types of utility companies.

25
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.810
Michael Shannon: Water processing sewage.

26
00:04:44.880 --> 00:05:02.520
Michael Shannon: That you know the electric grid municipal lights, you know stop lights, and I mean just vitality traffic lighting, I mean terrible traffic lights wind farms solar farms nuclear facilities, the list goes on and on.

27
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.780
Michael Shannon: Those types of facilities have are you know.

28
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:18.060
Michael Shannon: well known for their specialty embedded devices system on ships sensors real time operating systems.

29
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:31.260
Michael Shannon: That present vulnerabilities there are organizations like the gic gic has a whole bunch of different.

30
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:41.370
Michael Shannon: certifications and usually have to go through sands.org to get a gic certification.

31
00:05:42.660 --> 00:06:02.490
Michael Shannon: Sometimes you can not do that not go through a sans.org and you can just try to take the exam but, yet you kind of have to challenge it like you have to apply and say I have this experience and then challenge it and not pay to go to a boot camp for a week.

32
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:21.060
Michael Shannon: So I did that to get my G SEC there the G SEC is kind of their version of security, plus or SS CP so I didn't want to go pay $7,000 to get that I wanted that certification, so I.

33
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:38.040
Michael Shannon: Applied challenge did, and I just had to pay for the exam which was still expensive like 1500 dollars or something, but they have the point i'm making is they have like specialty certifications for like skater and embedded systems.

34
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:47.550
Michael Shannon: it's kind of like storage area networking it's kind of it's a real specialty from an IT standpoint and a security standpoint.

35
00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:01.440
Michael Shannon: We want to if we can we want to test the newer embedded devices, you know in some sandbox environment type to hypervisor or whatever before deploying.

36
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:12.750
Michael Shannon: The problem is a lot of these legacy embedded devices they're embedded there in use they're in production and we don't really have a substitute.

37
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:22.620
Michael Shannon: We don't have other vendor solutions and even over the like the last two years that's really reduced our you know our options.

38
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:31.950
Michael Shannon: A lot of these especially devices aren't necessarily involved in our inventory system, why they should be are changing configuration management.

39
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:42.180
Michael Shannon: patch management, maybe impossible they're just simply aren't know patch there are no patches or the vendor or the manufacturer is no longer in business.

40
00:07:44.160 --> 00:08:02.070
Michael Shannon: We can use digitally signed code on some newer solution definitely want to do that if we can run these with trusted platform module or with trusted operating systems like se Linux that can be part of trusted computing even better.

41
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.630
Michael Shannon: If you were running specialty devices and at a Google.

42
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:20.790
Michael Shannon: site, they would be you know adherents zero trust they would need to be running those you know secure platforms and trusted computing.

43
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:34.590
Michael Shannon: You know, it takes possibly a special skill set with these other specialty systems now, these are the reason, these three are listed is this is one of the objectives.

44
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:47.070
Michael Shannon: Okay, so don't forget about the multifunction printers you know the biz hubs that kind of do it all, you know, a combination of email, fax scanner printer.

45
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.390
Michael Shannon: It can make Espresso I don't know does everything right.

46
00:08:53.550 --> 00:09:05.190
Michael Shannon: Those are usually on the network and those ports, you know from a layer to security standpoint, we have those specialty devices that are kind of always on that.

47
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:14.880
Michael Shannon: ethernet port and you know Can somebody unplug that you know biz hub and plug their laptop into it.

48
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.380
Michael Shannon: Hopefully, if you're using dot one X.

49
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.250
Michael Shannon: That particular port is not enabled.

50
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.330
Michael Shannon: To accept a P O l frames so.

51
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.760
Michael Shannon: it's been restricted.

52
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:49.380
Michael Shannon: So UAE these are unmanned aerial vehicles drones those are security issues, because they can be used against us as a reconnaissance tool for our physical security, but they can be hijacked or hacked as well.

53
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.420
Michael Shannon: advantage adaptive voltage scaling.

54
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.820
Michael Shannon: And they're really know what that is.

55
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:09.690
Michael Shannon: A closed loop dynamic power minimization method adult you know I haven't dealt with that in years on system boards adjusting the voltage sent to a computer chip.

56
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.640
Michael Shannon: You know, a closed loop system has the ability to self correct, I know that.

57
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:42.690
Michael Shannon: On most systems, the legacy bios to be ios basic input output system has been replaced, but like I said on legacy components and devices, they may be still running the traditional bios which is vulnerable.

58
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:50.910
Michael Shannon: you're you're more modern workstations and laptops and PCs and servers are running the.

59
00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:12.030
Michael Shannon: which provides boot integrity better security now, it says offers the ability to protect with a password well, you could have a password on a legacy system border motherboard with a legacy bios that's not necessarily a new thing.

60
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:27.420
Michael Shannon: But we talked about the hardware root of trust, and this is part of zero trust moving anchoring trustworthiness down to the hardware and depending less on software.

61
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:41.970
Michael Shannon: security systems on a chip So these are trusted execution environments trusted computing so those modules embedded in a system, a system board a server board.

62
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:50.670
Michael Shannon: Self encrypting drives its were transparently encrypts without the knowledge or the.

63
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.210
Michael Shannon: interaction of the end user.

64
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.840
Michael Shannon: hardware security module talked about those.

65
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:14.580
Michael Shannon: So part of zero trust is using those low level tamper resistant security chips to store passwords encryption keys private keys certificates to provide security services.

66
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:26.370
Michael Shannon: Self encrypting drives will implement F D full disk encryption often like I said, without end user intervention.

67
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:46.020
Michael Shannon: Providing pre boot authentication possibly with the certificate, it can enhance endpoint security, so this would be something part of like Palo Alto networks next generation endpoint security would involve self encrypting drives.

68
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:53.880
Michael Shannon: opal.

69
00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:02.040
Michael Shannon: Security subsystem class specifications created by the trusted computing group.

70
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:10.110
Michael Shannon: high performance computing this may be done in your own data Center.

71
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:27.420
Michael Shannon: But for sure you're going to be getting access to high performance computing at a cloud provider they're going to offer specialized images they're going to offer more expensive machine images to do high performance computing.

72
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:40.740
Michael Shannon: I know that aws that I would say all of their data centers maybe not all of them, but the majority of their data centers they have transition to 100 gigabit.

73
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.070
Michael Shannon: So.

74
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:54.660
Michael Shannon: they're going to offer high performance computing images for doing you know high speed calculations Ai.

75
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.180
Michael Shannon: Those types of things.

76
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:15.270
Michael Shannon: And one of the vulnerabilities of high performance computing is think about a cluster or distributed high performance computers, if there is a Bot or distributed attack it's going to happen much quicker because it just the speed that these systems operate.

77
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.450
Michael Shannon: They may not, they may run you know specialized hardware stacks so high performance computing.

78
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:38.160
Michael Shannon: Well, often by the way, run for their storage they'll use what's called a femoral instance store so as opposed to like having a.

79
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:50.670
Michael Shannon: elastic block store that's just virtualized over the network from a raid array of hard disk or solid state drives this is directly attached at the hypervisor.

80
00:14:51.210 --> 00:15:00.390
Michael Shannon: That the htc blades are running it, so this is the ephemeral storage, so if you were to stop the high performance computing instance.

81
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:10.770
Michael Shannon: Like stop it or terminated that data would be lost so because of the type of computing that it does it needs those.

82
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:26.040
Michael Shannon: Directly attached solid state drives to store temporary files log files to do other calculations, with a femoral storage so at a cloud provider, yes, we divide up.

83
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:39.960
Michael Shannon: Blocker volume storage from object storage, but even within block storage that can be elastic abstracted block storage over the network.

84
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:52.860
Michael Shannon: or it could be that directly attached ephemeral instance store with the elastic storage, if you have it let's say attached to a Linux red hat Linux server.

85
00:15:53.340 --> 00:16:04.560
Michael Shannon: And you stop or you terminate the server the block storage is elastic and there's a snapshot created of it automatically so you don't lose the data.

86
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:16.020
Michael Shannon: And since you've been creating snapshots you could something did happen, you could just recreate the volume from the snapshot that happens to be stored in object storage.

87
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:25.770
Michael Shannon: This effect this a femoral instance store, however, that you might use with a high performance computing instance that's the ephemeral.

88
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.080
Michael Shannon: it's temporary.

89
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:37.860
Michael Shannon: edge computing the term edge computing really relates to content distribution networking.

90
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:53.160
Michael Shannon: Okay, now I would say, from the standpoint of a service provider, they would broaden the term edge computing, but I would say, from the standpoint of this exam.

91
00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:10.920
Michael Shannon: Is C squared is going to is going to define edge computing as basically distributing content getting as close to the customer as possible, for example, caching in reddest clusters at.

92
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:21.660
Michael Shannon: providers broadband providers telecoms, whatever that you have high speed fiber connections with.

93
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.190
Michael Shannon: So your corporate edge is really blurred.

94
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:40.320
Michael Shannon: that's what is C squared we consider this edge computing I would say that would be broadened by a cloud provider to include it will be called hybrid cloud.

95
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.060
Michael Shannon: And like a diagram right.

96
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.560
for that.

97
00:17:51.180 --> 00:18:10.980
Michael Shannon: So if you're using something like akamai or cloud flare or aws cloud front, there are security mechanisms for sure when you're the one doing the the devops but you're developing the Web application or the content that you're distributing you'll have a node.

98
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:18.060
Michael Shannon: And that node at the edge location will probably be running a web application firewall.

99
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:31.080
Michael Shannon: You know, doing the deep packet inspection it's not simply going to say we're only going to allow http https from this prefix to this IP address.

100
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:43.620
Michael Shannon: But you can use, you know you can restrict certain geographical regions or countries from using your distribution you're gonna you know run this firewall to look for.

101
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:55.230
Michael Shannon: Cross site scripting variance and injection attacks right the kind of you know, the oh wasp top 10 type stuff.

102
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.870
Michael Shannon: So you'll deploy a wealth there you'll usually have cloud based.

103
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.200
Michael Shannon: distributed denial of service protection.

104
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:19.380
Michael Shannon: All the API calls to that, from a management standpoint would be digitally signed to mls enabled endpoints you can control.

105
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:28.320
Michael Shannon: Who can download content for your distribution, but you can also control, who can go through the distribution node to get to the back end content.

106
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:44.880
Michael Shannon: And if it's cloud flare akamai or cloud front that backend content, the original origin, we call that could be in your data Center it could be at azure blob Google cloud storage.

107
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.190
Michael Shannon: aws s3 or multiple locations.

108
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.790
Michael Shannon: For high availability.

109
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.460
Michael Shannon: So.

110
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:09.120
Michael Shannon: Next is the transition to physical security now there's not a dedicated physical security, you know.

111
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:20.250
Michael Shannon: domain it's part of operational security and asset security right, so it kind of bleeds over into a couple of different domains.

112
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:34.710
Michael Shannon: But this is that third category of control, we have administrative slash managerial controls technical controls and then physical.

113
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:44.820
Michael Shannon: And the goal is to protect from a wide variety of different man or people made.

114
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.160
Michael Shannon: threat actors, but also natural disasters.

115
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.560
Michael Shannon: And you know pandemics supply system.

116
00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.680
Michael Shannon: interruptions socio political threats like we're going through now.

117
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.890
Michael Shannon: And Ukraine and on and on.

118
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.860
Michael Shannon: I already alluded to the fact that.

119
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.190
Michael Shannon: under the umbrella of physical security, we do have primary and secondary loss.

120
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:27.000
Michael Shannon: You know, probably the number one you know the worst case scenario primary loss loss of life or injury.

121
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:39.330
Michael Shannon: And like I said it depends on your organization and the way that you handle risk as to you know is that the primary loss.

122
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.210
Michael Shannon: And it can be secondary again cascading.

123
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:53.550
Michael Shannon: Loss now we typically take a Defense in depth approach when we design our physical security solution.

124
00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:09.060
Michael Shannon: Okay, just like we would have a logical Defense in depth with a series of infrastructure devices right a perimeter edge router and then maybe a honey net.

125
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:28.590
Michael Shannon: And then maybe behind that a firewall and then maybe ips sensor than a multi layer switch in all of those things in line providing Defense in depth, or a single highly available router or appliance running all the services and the Defense in depth happens.

126
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:45.720
Michael Shannon: To the order of processing of the data Graham and frame moving through well really the data gram flowing through the device right the data Graham the frame doesn't flow through the device the frame comes to the device.

127
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:58.200
Michael Shannon: The data Graham goes through the device, and then, whatever the outbound or the egress interface technology is that's where the frame comes in.

128
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:11.730
Michael Shannon: Right, so when I said the frame to the device know the data ground packet to the device, so we have a Defense in depth approach with physical security and it needs to be methodical.

129
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:29.070
Michael Shannon: Okay, so you would start at the edge of your facility your property line if that's the case like a at a campus and you would work your way back to your where your most valuable assets are could be a walk in safe.

130
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:36.270
Michael Shannon: It could be a safe in the CEOs or the president's office in her office, it could be the data Center.

131
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.850
Michael Shannon: But a methodical approach outside in inside out now of course.

132
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:56.850
Michael Shannon: It depends on you know where you're located you know if you're in a if you're in a business Center and you basically just a single office and you're sharing.

133
00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:17.310
Michael Shannon: with other businesses or you're on a floor of a building and there's multiple businesses Those are all factors, we have to consider, whatever our domain of control is which may be, you know if we're on a floor of a building the locked door that comes into the foyer day.

134
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:31.770
Michael Shannon: Or the area where the reception is that's our domain regardless outside in or inside out methodical approach, one thing we do have to know is what are all of the.

135
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:46.920
Michael Shannon: ingress and egress points, and that would be including air ducks any access could Could somebody easily access through a wall if it's just simply you know.

136
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:55.710
Michael Shannon: it's if the walls between your different offices are just simply like you know particle board stuff.

137
00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.700
Michael Shannon: You have to consider that.

138
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.690
Michael Shannon: Any area through the roof.

139
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:11.730
Michael Shannon: All possible ingress and egress points of the facility, have to be examined.

140
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:21.300
Michael Shannon: But if we do have a perimeter like a property line perimeter let's say we're going to start there, what kind of barriers are we going to have.

141
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:30.090
Michael Shannon: You know, sometimes you can just have a man made lake or a pond.

142
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.250
Michael Shannon: And you'll see that, like when you're coming into some large company.

143
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:52.890
Michael Shannon: And you as you approach their entry you'll see you know ponds, you know, like wow What are those for are they fishing at for lunch they go out to lunch and fishing know they're kind of a moat it's a modern day moat.

144
00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:05.670
Michael Shannon: You can use landscaping hedge rows trees as barriers, combined with your fencing of various types.

145
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.440
Michael Shannon: Do you have the ability to only come one way.

146
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.720
Michael Shannon: With a vehicle.

147
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:30.540
Michael Shannon: And you can't go back there's a tire shredder, for example, bollards bollards are used too often a temporary bollards can be used like little plastic things that stick up are there, the cones you can use those to just temporarily redirect.

148
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:39.660
Michael Shannon: pedestrian traffic in on a path you want them to stay on or they can be permanent bollards of different types.

149
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.650
Michael Shannon: and different types of gates with different ratings.

150
00:26:44.940 --> 00:27:01.590
Michael Shannon: So you know, the point is, you need to be aware of the different perimeter barrier types and what's appropriate and what's affordable for your organization, you know, in the US, we separate gates and do like four main classes.

151
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:12.840
Michael Shannon: So if you add an apartment complex or a you know single family home, you would have like a class one residential gate.

152
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:32.250
Michael Shannon: You know, as a hook, and you open it up, then you go to you know commercial class to like on a parking garage it would come down at the end of the day, maybe you get to physically bring it down, it may look like just a you know event I be completely.

153
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:46.410
Michael Shannon: Solid it may be, you can still see through it like a cage all the way up to the kinds of things you would see at prisons and airports and military installations.

154
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:57.210
Michael Shannon: So obviously you know most organizations, you have a campus or facility, are going to have.

155
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:17.850
Michael Shannon: Protected fence barriers, which is where they're going to begin on their Defense in depth bollards typically concrete or strong metal high tech bollards, however, can you know be raised and lowered can be mechanical they can also include cameras and sensors of various types.

156
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:29.700
Michael Shannon: Probably the most the least expensive and most common you know preventative are determined control that is is signage.

157
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:36.660
Michael Shannon: You definitely if you're going to have a preventative control in the form of an electric fence.

158
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:51.180
Michael Shannon: you're going to have you're going to combine that with the deterrent control every six to eight feet of a sign saying warning, this is an electric fence like you might see it, a military base or a prison.

159
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:59.010
Michael Shannon: I live in Texas, and we have a lot of both Okay, a lot of both.

160
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.540
Michael Shannon: Signs window stickers scientists, you can just have.

161
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.190
Michael Shannon: You know.

162
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.940
Michael Shannon: In the in the grass or in different areas.

163
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.910
Michael Shannon: You know, we have banners but those are logical lizard technical controls.

164
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:36.690
Michael Shannon: So, like a banner that comes up if you try to access a router or a multi layer switch or some corporate edge device and you're trying to you know brute force, maybe a banner comes up saying I know authorized, you know access will be punishable by law or whatever that's a logical banner.

165
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:45.990
Michael Shannon: But a banner is also signage you know authorized personnel only beware of dog keep out.

166
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.630
Michael Shannon: Armed guard on duty no trespassing all those good things.

167
00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:05.580
Michael Shannon: We have security cameras closed circuit TV, these can be wired or wireless these are, this is an important security control, obviously.

168
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:11.970
Michael Shannon: It kind of checks off several boxes right it's detective.

169
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:21.450
Michael Shannon: Primarily detective but just the you know just the fact that the cameras exist, can be a deterrent.

170
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:32.250
Michael Shannon: You have to be aware of the media that it's writing the video to protection of that the high availability of that.

171
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:46.980
Michael Shannon: Can that can the system itself be hacked it's on a network is it accessible over the Internet, so you know there's a couple ways to approach this just like.

172
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:57.990
Michael Shannon: Your cameras work hand in hand with with lighting, you want to eliminate any kind of dead spots your lighting can be internal and or external.

173
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:07.830
Michael Shannon: It can be continuous something can trip it whether it's something that's trip, but with a timer or through some sensor.

174
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.940
Michael Shannon: It can be, emergency lighting standby lighting and there's different use cases.

175
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.470
Michael Shannon: There we go.

176
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:37.380
Michael Shannon: sodium vapor is good outdoor lighting VF appear live in a foggy area like San Francisco or San Diego summer on the coast mercury vapor is the kind of lighting, you see, often like city lights or in a stadium.

177
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.850
Michael Shannon: Right.

178
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:46.710
Michael Shannon: so very important another term to be aware of industrial camouflage.

179
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:59.940
Michael Shannon: Your cameras your surveillance devices your sensors are often camouflaged there in trees and landscaping elements many times when you're on a.

180
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:20.310
Michael Shannon: let's say a campus of a of a company like a high tech company and you'll see you know art statues that's not just there for aesthetic reasons, usually that type of statue or artwork or whatever is industrial camouflage.

181
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.280
Michael Shannon: Okay.

182
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:37.320
Michael Shannon: security guards lots of considerations are they 24 seven right.

183
00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:49.740
Michael Shannon: Every day, all you know, maybe three shifts three eight hour shifts or maybe you just have security guards during business hours or maybe you just have security guards that are there.

184
00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:56.370
Michael Shannon: That are not business hours, maybe you have to share your security guard with other businesses.

185
00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:08.310
Michael Shannon: The guards, maybe if they if they are your guards, or they employees are they contractors do they come from a third party are they licensed are they armed How does that affect.

186
00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:20.880
Michael Shannon: You know, an armed guard that that may affect your insurance your business insurance policy but security guards can do a wide variety of things besides just you know.

187
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:32.010
Michael Shannon: be a present determined, they can often be at a guard gate at your perimeter and they're looking at credentials they're checking credentials.

188
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:39.150
Michael Shannon: Maybe they're doing you know when somebody's trying to get into facility you're going to have them pull aside.

189
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:52.770
Michael Shannon: backup and park over here because it's going to take us 15 or 20 minutes because we're going to go and we're going to do some background we're going to do some you know we're going to run some services against your identity.

190
00:33:54.540 --> 00:34:02.220
Michael Shannon: Maybe you know follow up on some facial recognition technology if you go to interview.

191
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:13.350
Michael Shannon: You know if you go to interview for a high tech company it's not unlikely that right when you walk in there'll be a security guard and they'll have you, you know.

192
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:22.260
Michael Shannon: step back and they're going to take a picture of you they're going to collect your identity information right you're the proofing.

193
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:36.840
Michael Shannon: they'll get two forms of ID and they'll take a picture and let make a temporary badge that you have to wear at all times and then that may give you access, but you may only be able to get access with an escort.

194
00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.320
Michael Shannon: But security guards are often involved in those activities but they're also responders.

195
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:55.320
Michael Shannon: If there's somebody walking around on your floor without a badge on you don't recognize them they're going to come and you're not going to interact with them you're going to call the security guard security team.

196
00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:08.430
Michael Shannon: They may also have to interface with other law enforcement agencies so did you are they are they hired are they contracted or they certified or they licensed armed or unarmed.

197
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:15.660
Michael Shannon: Are they involved are you involved with the screening and the background check of the security guard.

198
00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:22.830
Michael Shannon: or and or are they involved on doing that for guests.

199
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:34.500
Michael Shannon: That show up or contractors or temporary workers or whatever or visitors who is going to do the online training of the guards I mentioned robots and robots centuries.

200
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:47.820
Michael Shannon: This is an older model, but this is just a prototype the Samsung sgr a one a sixth century gun that's used at the Korean dmz.

201
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.630
Michael Shannon: Like I said black mirror kind of stuff.

202
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.680
Michael Shannon: lots of different ways to.

203
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.350
Michael Shannon: detect motion.

204
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.580
Michael Shannon: Okay, very important.

205
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.450
Michael Shannon: Additional control physical control.

206
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:17.820
Michael Shannon: You know, most of us if we have an alarm system at our business that are home, a lot of us are using similar like electromechanical.

207
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:33.150
Michael Shannon: Right you've got something on the window or the door and if it's breached that breaking electrical circuit, if you don't put in a code within 30 seconds to a minute the alarms go off.

208
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.460
Michael Shannon: Others will use passive infrared.

209
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.770
Michael Shannon: photo electric or combinations of okay.

210
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:53.250
Michael Shannon: So whatever you're using to detect the unauthorized intrusion, it is a trigger something.

211
00:36:54.270 --> 00:37:16.350
Michael Shannon: It may send a silent alarm to the security operations Center or the security guard, it may be something that flashes on a display panel, there may be some audible or a combination of lighting, emergency lighting and you know 130 plus decimal Horn or sound or whistle.

212
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:23.520
Michael Shannon: A text message, it could be sent phone call email you get the idea.

213
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:35.160
Michael Shannon: It depends so JEREMY what type of digital signature is used with API calls.

214
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:42.360
Michael Shannon: i'm assuming this is an application programming interface request it depends.

215
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.750
Michael Shannon: Sometimes they'll use just.

216
00:37:46.770 --> 00:38:00.900
Michael Shannon: You know RSA elliptic curve something elliptic curve a digital signature a aws they use a protocol like if you're doing.

217
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:09.840
Michael Shannon: Like programmatic console access, like the aws console they have they use what's called signature for.

218
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.570
Michael Shannon: that's the protocol that they use to digitally sign the API calls.

219
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:31.950
Michael Shannon: But it's some type of a symmetric key crypto system using either an access key or a key pair so there's there's different ways to digitally sign the API calls.

220
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:44.280
Michael Shannon: The most common form of physical security mechanism by far is the lock and again for the exam, it is a preventative mechanism.

221
00:38:45.150 --> 00:39:00.780
Michael Shannon: Okay, we don't want to get we don't want to argue with ourselves it's gonna go with the obvious if they give you some type of scenario, we know that the last can be physical we have various types of physical locks physical locks there's different ways to breach them.

222
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:20.250
Michael Shannon: We can use PICs, and these are kits you can go you're familiar with what lock picks or raking looks like just go do a Google search a rake is something that you insert all the way to the back of the physical and it kind of you know rakes it.

223
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:36.480
Michael Shannon: As a as opposed to the PIC that usually uses two components and, of course, as mentioned all physical locks are subject to brute force one degree or another.

224
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:49.380
Michael Shannon: But I wouldn't get too bogged down, and all the different types of locks Okay, but usually we want to combine and have more than one lock.

225
00:39:50.430 --> 00:40:09.000
Michael Shannon: We would like to use locks that would contribute to a multi multi factor authentication process, so, in addition to just presenting some smart card or token possibly we're going to have a crypto lock or some other biometric sensor.

226
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:17.880
Michael Shannon: And it really depends upon the data sensitivity, the property whatever is, on the other side of that lock right.

227
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:34.410
Michael Shannon: So I already kind of talked about this, you know physical security Bay involved, you know personnel controls.

228
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:48.930
Michael Shannon: guests visitors contractors temporary workers, we always want to consider, as this is an administrative type control but piggybacking and tailgating.

229
00:40:50.340 --> 00:41:05.040
Michael Shannon: Right piggybacking and tailgating where somebody presents their card or their token or their badge they go in the door, and you just follow right behind and without presenting yours.

230
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.270
Michael Shannon: Also part of physical security is power.

231
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:25.320
Michael Shannon: And usually we want to have more than one power source to our facility, if possible, we like to have redundancy.

232
00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:37.320
Michael Shannon: want we want redundancy in our site to site vpn we want redundancy in our Internet connectivity if we can't we want redundancy and power now that's not always available.

233
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:54.450
Michael Shannon: in different regions of the world, the electrical power grid maybe very you know monopolistic Okay, so you just don't have even if you have multiple sources.

234
00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:06.570
Michael Shannon: Of let's say who's billing you for electrical or providing your electrical it's still coming from the same grid you're just going through a different broker right.

235
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:27.210
Michael Shannon: But we have to make sure that we as part of business continuity and continuity of operations, we need the ups right the interoperable power supplies and generators, which I have, I have ups, the ups goes into my generator.

236
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.910
Michael Shannon: So a backup generators.

237
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.020
Michael Shannon: Diesel driven perhaps.

238
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.000
Michael Shannon: blackouts and brownouts or blackouts a complete.

239
00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.560
Michael Shannon: interruption of electrical power for a period of time.

240
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:58.170
Michael Shannon: Now, on the exam once you to remember that, often, yes, the blackout, is something that we want to be able to.

241
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.420
Michael Shannon: protect against.

242
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:05.310
Michael Shannon: But often a brown out can be more destructive.

243
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:11.340
Michael Shannon: The intentional or unintentional sag or slump or voltage drop.

244
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.080
Michael Shannon: can actually do more damage than simply we don't have power right now.

245
00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:27.390
Michael Shannon: So we have to have contingencies, and this is, of course, part of.

246
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:42.180
Michael Shannon: Business continuity environmental controls, you know, fortunately, because of virtualization and the ability to use hypervisor many companies now have been able to.

247
00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:58.590
Michael Shannon: shrink down their server farms and their data centers so we no longer have the same kind of power consumption needs we no longer have the same carbon footprint we don't have the same age VAC needs.

248
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:10.500
Michael Shannon: But, regardless of the fact that we have been able to condense our data Center down to a much smaller area or a much smaller facility, we still have to contend with.

249
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:26.430
Michael Shannon: ventilation air conditioning temperature humidity and those types of controls need to be redundant and often the H pack systems and the control system should be on a separate network.

250
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:34.980
Michael Shannon: They shouldn't be accessible across the local area network, it should be isolated maybe.

251
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:50.370
Michael Shannon: As part of your security operations Center or maybe you have a facilities department that's a separate department and, of course, you know physical security of all of those different controls, physical and software.

252
00:44:53.580 --> 00:45:05.850
Michael Shannon: You have to be considering, are you dealing with any type of chemicals that are harmful chemical leaks biological leaks those things are part of the environmental controls.

253
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:16.050
Michael Shannon: You know, historically traditionally in large data centers or server rooms, we would have the hot and cold aisles.

254
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:24.780
Michael Shannon: Where you had your devices in the racks lined up where the fans were all facing in the same direction.

255
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:46.290
Michael Shannon: Where the hot air went and then it got maybe moving through a cold aisle to a separate system or a room, but you know, generally speaking, the recommended humidity for the server rooms, or the data centers or whatever you call them 40 to 60% humidity.

256
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:51.270
Michael Shannon: And then the degrees 72 to.

257
00:45:52.380 --> 00:46:00.120
Michael Shannon: 76 as it that's in Fahrenheit so somebody can convert that to Celsius for me and put that out there.

258
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:03.750
Michael Shannon: So if.

259
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:21.930
Michael Shannon: Most of us when we go into a facility and we are using the wired ethernet when we go to the cubicle or the desk that we're at and we plug in our ethernet cable with the R J 45 jack you know into the the port.

260
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:31.920
Michael Shannon: The the the cable run behind that port is not going directly to a switch.

261
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:44.160
Michael Shannon: Like right into a switch port, maybe in a small office Home Office in most facilities that cable is a part of a distribution run.

262
00:46:44.700 --> 00:47:03.780
Michael Shannon: And there are distribution frames so it's going to maybe a closet or a room where it's being punched down on a distribution frame and then the cabling continues, whether under the floor through the wall, or the ceiling to either another distribution frame or then finally into the.

263
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:09.660
Michael Shannon: server room or the wherever the network room or whatever data Center.

264
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:22.050
Michael Shannon: depends on the size of the building, you may have distribution closets you know per floor or several in a building and then extends to your campus so you have to be.

265
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:32.040
Michael Shannon: You know that's part of your physical security is securing those cable run areas, maybe cameras other types of sensors.

266
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:43.560
Michael Shannon: You don't want people malicious insiders or somebody who's conducting a hoax coming in and disrupting that because that distribution frame and wiring can be quite elaborate.

267
00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:54.000
Michael Shannon: The larger your campus the larger your built building now usually this is under the kind of umbrella of the facilities management and the network.

268
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.740
Michael Shannon: Right, the network engineers and operators.

269
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:11.160
Michael Shannon: But as a security manager, we want to make sure that whatever departments and teams that are responsible for this infrastructure that they're taking the proper.

270
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.050
Michael Shannon: physical security precautions.

271
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:41.520
Michael Shannon: So i've got several slides here that just talks about controlling physical access, you know we're talking about a strong doors multiple locks maybe no or fewer windows, if you do have windows secure security windows that have metal mesh in them.

272
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.950
Michael Shannon: Biometric multi factor authentication to these areas.

273
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:58.200
Michael Shannon: Obviously we need to have automatic fire detection and suppression systems i'm going to talk about those here the last slide.

274
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:20.190
Michael Shannon: An air gap is the physical separation so often, when I mentioned like we want our age fact systems or environmental systems to be on a separate network those would be air gapped possibly and have no connectivity to the Internet or no wi fi management capability.

275
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:28.680
Michael Shannon: Now, having systems air gapped isn't a you know foolproof solution.

276
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:43.920
Michael Shannon: Just because it's done on the local area network or has no wi fi access that's really where physical security and personnel security comes in, remember the Stuxnet virus, the famous virus that.

277
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.000
Michael Shannon: I guess everybody knows who did it now.

278
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:54.660
Michael Shannon: The two countries that were involved, and you know at the Iranian.

279
00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.180
Michael Shannon: nuclear facility.

280
00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:05.640
Michael Shannon: It was an air gapped environment, the Stuxnet virus got in on the laptop of a contractor.

281
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:07.530
Michael Shannon: who came in.

282
00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:26.790
Michael Shannon: So remember Eric yapping certain systems in certain areas, definitely is important but it's again that also emphasizes the need for physical and personal security and a zero trust environment.

283
00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:31.170
Michael Shannon: Constant logging and auditing.

284
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:42.120
Michael Shannon: Your secure enclosures if you have a clean desk policy, you have a locking desk.

285
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:50.040
Michael Shannon: Now those those locks on those desks are easily pickle by somebody with.

286
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:57.090
Michael Shannon: who spends an hour on YouTube, but they also may have you know locking cabinets or whatever.

287
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:09.210
Michael Shannon: But we're we're talking about you know safes either embedded safes a standalone safe, that is, you know.

288
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:16.890
Michael Shannon: bolted down into the cement floor reinforced filing cabinets.

289
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:41.040
Michael Shannon: These may be mandates, by the way of you know you're in the military or government agency or whatever, but the safes that protect those valuables currencies precious metals policy insurance policies bonds stocks cyber currency wallets failsafe passwords.

290
00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:46.560
Michael Shannon: break the glass passwords keys all those good things.

291
00:51:48.630 --> 00:52:00.330
Michael Shannon: In the US, we have the ul the underwriters laboratory, and so they give a specifications and classifications for safes so you know if you're involved in that.

292
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:14.700
Michael Shannon: As far as physical security goes the example here is that a tool resistant to 30 means it'll take 30 minutes to use a tool and a torch to get through it.

293
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:33.180
Michael Shannon: So the locking mechanism often me when I have multiple locking mechanisms, possibly a biometric maybe voice recognition an ocular fingerprint the material that's used the weight, whether it's in the wall.

294
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:40.620
Michael Shannon: doesn't have a relaxing devices that have a time lock on it does it connect to.

295
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:49.290
Michael Shannon: Does it have the ability to send an alarm system or to law enforcement okay.

296
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:55.350
Michael Shannon: got to be aware of our media storage facilities, where we store our.

297
00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:15.120
Michael Shannon: database backups whatever media type we're using redundant spares hot spares are hard copies of our documentation right we don't have everything, everything is not digital, we do have some hard copies even microfiche is still used so.

298
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:29.850
Michael Shannon: Some storage facilities that are storing let's say evidence, so if you're a law enforcement entity and evidence room or an evidence storage may be a different type of facility.

299
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:37.470
Michael Shannon: For example, it's not going to be like a dry wall it's going to be concrete or brick or whatever.

300
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:49.350
Michael Shannon: It may have no window access if it has it may only have one way in one way out, if there is a fire door.

301
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.890
Michael Shannon: A fire way out there'll be no the door the on the outside, will have no way to.

302
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.150
Michael Shannon: there'll be no handle whatsoever.

303
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:04.800
Michael Shannon: it'll just be a smooth door, you can get out an emergency door.

304
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:10.230
Michael Shannon: But i've seen areas that don't even have only have one way in one way out.

305
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.710
Michael Shannon: So.

306
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:26.790
Michael Shannon: Also, along the lines you know the destruction and disposition policy, you know the physical destruction will be part of physical security there's a nist.

307
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.740
Michael Shannon: Special publication, you might want to add that to your knowledge base.

308
00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:39.780
Michael Shannon: The guidelines for media sanitation okay.

309
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:44.580
Michael Shannon: I mentioned evidence storage.

310
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:55.080
Michael Shannon: And again with evidence storage, it also brings in the administrative control of chain of custody, that we need to be aware of.

311
00:54:56.190 --> 00:55:08.010
Michael Shannon: And evidence storage, maybe if it's the law enforcement type of environment, often we're going to be using some type of digital evidence management or inventory software.

312
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:20.220
Michael Shannon: Right, this is not like some 1970s COP show where the police officer comes in and he's like there's like a you know, a window with like.

313
00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:30.330
Michael Shannon: Little bars on it it's got a little opening and the guy you know here's my here's the heroin, I found, and then you sign off on and it's all just done with paperwork.

314
00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:35.340
Michael Shannon: No, we have modern digital evidence management software.

315
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:55.710
Michael Shannon: We have modern solutions and things are being tagged they do with rf ID tags other asset tags right they can be scanned maybe a qr code so we're using much more modern techniques now to maintain that evidence and that chain of custody.

316
00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.520
Michael Shannon: I mentioned earlier, that a man trap.

317
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:06.810
Michael Shannon: To truly be a man trap, the person has to be trapped okay so.

318
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:21.930
Michael Shannon: The individual gets into this area this enclosed area and the door locks behind them either electronically or mechanically and then the door in front of them, so there is a period of time.

319
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:39.840
Michael Shannon: and often that there's no piggybacking or tailgating it's one person at a time and then they may be talking through an intercom system or a video camera system, there may be a bullet bullet proof window and they're interfacing with somebody to provide credentials, or whatever.

320
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:56.190
Michael Shannon: can include once you're in that area can include include some biometric reader along with possible closed circuit TV and security guards.

321
00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.270
Michael Shannon: A.

322
00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:04.470
Michael Shannon: Alright, one last thing.

323
00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:21.330
Michael Shannon: And then we'll then we'll finish up for the day but a faraday cages can be built around servers can be built around racks of equipment of your infrastructure of your data Center.

324
00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:44.250
Michael Shannon: And these are to prevent damage from some electromagnetic interference or pulse or solar flare or whatever, so the faraday cage can be built into the actual design of the room, it may be enclosures It may be a bag a faraday bag.

325
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.330
Michael Shannon: I have faraday bags, you can get them.

326
00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:50.970
Michael Shannon: You can buy them online.

327
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:58.920
Michael Shannon: Like there that these like US military grade of different sizes, so my.

328
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:03.960
Michael Shannon: Cyber currency wallets there in a faraday bags.

329
00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:16.920
Michael Shannon: and technically, you can take a mobile phone and put it into a faraday bag and put it in your microwave oven and rude and then take it out in the phones and damaged don't test that.

330
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:25.440
Michael Shannon: But this may be something that, as part of your physical security existing.

331
00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:32.130
Michael Shannon: You know, ongoing usage, or maybe something you're planning for in the future need to consider.

332
00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:45.240
Michael Shannon: yeah Victor says they're testing right now, oh no no don't test that alright so that's it there's a few more slides in here, you can you can when you're doing your study you can read up.

333
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:57.090
Michael Shannon: You know, like air gap couple of slides on air gap and then fire controls just remember there's three elements there's prevention, detection and suppression.

334
00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:12.900
Michael Shannon: The more we focus on prevention, the less we have to be concerned with detection and suppression right, the more effective the prevention that's going to remove the need for the other two areas, and then you may have to know.

335
00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:27.240
Michael Shannon: types of extinguishers and so that's the last slide of this session with the newer type K flammable liquids unique to cooking extinguished using dry powder okay.

336
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:36.510
Michael Shannon: So that's it uh yeah wi fi routers yeah I know that yeah people that's arguable.

337
00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:44.370
Michael Shannon: But we won't get into that debate, but it's that's that's true Andrew people do that.

338
00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:50.250
Michael Shannon: Maybe you should do that with your five g phone while you're at it.

339
00:59:51.600 --> 01:00:03.210
Michael Shannon: Alright folks Thank you a lot of great chat today a lot of you guys helping each other out men and women, helping each other out you guys are providing links.

340
01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:11.370
Michael Shannon: you're following up on some of the things you're you know it's all great really love that I encourage it right.

341
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:26.490
Michael Shannon: we're you know you guys are all in this together we're in this together and to get this CIS SP thing going to give that sort of occasion and then I want to see you in July, for the CCA SP boot camp That being said, i'm going to stop the recording.

342
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:30.210
Michael Shannon: Have a great.
